In a groundbreaking theory of our origins, Wrangham shows that the shift from raw to cooked foods was the key factor in human evolution. When our ancestors adapted to using fire, humanity began. Once our hominid ancestors began cooking their food, the human digestive tract shrank and the brain grew. Time once spent chewing tough raw food could be sued instead to hunt and to tend camp. Cooking became the basis for pair bonding and marriage, created the household, and even led to a sexual division of labor. Tracing the contemporary implications of our ancestors&rsquo; diets, <i>Catching Fire</i> sheds new light on how we came to be the social, intelligent, and sexual species we are today.

But beware of excessive choice: choice overload can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them, it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations, and it can make you blame yourself for any and all failures. In the long run, this can lead to decision-making paralysis, anxiety, and perpetual stress. And, in a culture that tells us that there is no excuse for falling short of perfection when your options are limitless, too much choice can lead to clinical depression.<br /><br />In <em>The Paradox of Choice</em>, Barry Schwartz explains at what point choice--the hallmark of individual freedom and self-determination that we so cherish--becomes detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz shows how the dramatic explosion in choice--from the mundane to the profound challenges of balancing career, family, and individual needs--has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution. Schwartz also shows how our obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse.<br /><br />By synthesizing current research in the social sciences, Schwartz makes the counterintuitive case that eliminating choices can greatly reduce the stress, anxiety, and busyness of our lives. He offers eleven practical steps on how to limit choices to a manageable number, have the discipline to focus on the important ones and ignore the rest, and ultimately derive greater satisfaction from the choices you have to make.<br /></p>", "average_rating": 3.82, "author": "Barry Schwartz", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/HarperCollins/9780061748998/1376505739.41.jpg"}},{"annotation": "", "uuid": "XMroowbRL2SxMEF6RwPDi9", "position": 0, "book": {"uuid": "uccXbpa5Jqtm7MS7yBGAxD", "status": 1, "oyster_summary": "", "language_code": "eng", "number_print_pages": 272, "title": "Sex on Six Legs", "publication_date": "2011-08-02", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "isbn": "9780547549170", "publisher": {"uuid": "mgiqkRVmdsaEkGeGuyRSFX", "name": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"}, "awards": [], "description": "<P>Insects have inspired fear, fascination, and enlightenment for centuries.

Conversely, can the body cause mental illness? What do we know today about their interaction? The relations between body and mind are the source of many problems that are currently treated separately by psychoanalysts and doctors because of the compartmentalisation between their disciplines. Despite differences in clinical practice, we all stand to benefit from a common understanding of the reciprocal influences of the mind and the body and the ways in which these are interrelated. It is time to stop treating the body in isolation from treatment of the mind and to understand that where the psychic apparatus fails in its key task of managing the excitations generated by the tensions and frustrations of everyday life, it is the body that takes over. With a wealth of clinical examples, the author proposes an innovative theoretical and clinical approach that seeks to break down the barriers between biology and psychoanalysis; he also demonstrates its benefits for the health and recovery of patients and its implications for disease prevention.", "average_rating": 0.0, "author": "Jean Benjamin Stora", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Karnac%20Books/9781780494999/1378571041.89.jpg"}},{"annotation": "", "uuid": "j4qp4UF6TSpJauct5BPc5h", "position": 14, "book": {"uuid": "toBWuUxSjUjiUDeDynnkua", "status": 1, "oyster_summary": "", "language_code": "eng", "number_print_pages": 304, "title": "The Physics of Wall Street", "publication_date": "2013-01-08", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "isbn": "9780547618296", "publisher": {"uuid": "mgiqkRVmdsaEkGeGuyRSFX", "name": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"}, "awards": [], "description": "<DIV>After the economic meltdown of 2008, Warren Buffett famously warned, &#8220;beware of geeks bearing formulas.&#8221; But as James Weatherall demonstrates, not all geeks are created equal. While many of the mathematicians and software engineers on Wall Street failed when their abstractions turned ugly in practice, a special breed of physicists has a much deeper history of revolutionizing finance. Taking us from fin-de-si&#232;cle Paris to Rat Pack-era Las Vegas, from wartime government labs to Yippie communes on the Pacific coast, Weatherall shows how physicists successfully brought their science to bear on some of the thorniest problems in economics, from options pricing to bubbles.<br><BR>The crisis was partly a failure of mathematical modeling. But even more, it was a failure of some very sophisticated financial institutions to think like physicists. Models&#8212;whether in science or finance&#8212;have limitations; they break down under certain conditions. And in 2008, sophisticated models fell into the hands of people who didn&#8217;t understand their purpose, and didn&#8217;t care. It was a catastrophic misuse of science.<br><BR>The solution, however, is not to give up on models; it's to make them better. Weatherall reveals the people and ideas on the cusp of a new era in finance. We see a geophysicist use a model designed for earthquakes to predict a massive stock market crash. We discover a physicist-run hedge fund that earned 2,478.6% over the course of the 1990s. And we see how an obscure idea from quantum theory might soon be used to create a far more accurate Consumer Price Index.<br>Both persuasive and accessible, <I>The Physics of Wall Street</I> is riveting history that will change how we think about our economic future.<BR></DIV>", "average_rating": 3.86, "author": "James Owen Weatherall", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Houghton%20Mifflin%20Harcourt/9780547618296/1390198992.0.jpg"}},{"annotation": "", "uuid": "eKYT942cnuqAPc6gqk9UQ4", "position": 13, "book": {"uuid": "biqDJrEqX6kHXqb4znMoL", "status": 1, "oyster_summary": "", "language_code": "English", "number_print_pages": 290, "title": "Football Physics", "publication_date": "2004-09-04", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "isbn": "9781609616120", "publisher": {"uuid": "vmtqxKpTiLdDSguXoUUQAA", "name": "Rodale"}, "awards": [], "description": "<p>This fascinating, one-of-a-kind book is the ultimate read for serious fans of America's most popular spectator sport.
