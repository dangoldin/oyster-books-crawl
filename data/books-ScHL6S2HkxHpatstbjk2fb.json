It is to these ordinary people that Peter Stamm grants center stage in his latest collection of short stories. Henry, a cowherd turned stuntman, crisscrosses the country, dreaming of meeting a woman. Inger, the Dane, refuses her skimpy life and takes off for Italy. Regina, so lonely in her big house since her children left and her husband passed away, discovers the world anew thanks to the Australian friend of her granddaughter, who helps Regina envision her next voyage.\r\n\r\nIn these stories, Stamm's clean style expresses despair without flash, through softness and small gestures, with disarming retorts full of derision and infinite tenderness. There, where life hesitates, ready to tip over\u2014with nothing yet played out\u2014is where these people and their stories exist. For us, they all become exceptional.

Now his first and last works come together for the first time  in print, in a collection aptly titled after his famous phrase, <I>We Are What We Pretend To Be</I>.<BR><br> Written to be sold under the pseudonym of &ldquo;Mark Harvey,&rdquo; <I>Basic Training</I>  was never published in Vonnegut&rsquo;s lifetime. It appears to have been  written in the late 1940s and is therefore Vonnegut&rsquo;s first ever  novella. It is a bitter, profoundly disenchanted story that satirizes  the military, authoritarianism, gender relationships, parenthood and  most of the assumed mid-century myths of the family. Haley Brandon, the  adolescent protagonist, comes to the farm of his relative, the old crazy  who insists upon being called The General, to learn to be a  straight-shooting American. Haley&rsquo;s only means of survival will lead him  to unflagging defiance of the General&rsquo;s deranged (but oh so American,  oh so military) values. This story and its thirtyish author were no  friends of the milieu to which the slick magazines&rsquo; advertisers were  pitching their products.<BR><br> When Vonnegut passed away in 2007, he left his last novel unfinished. Entitled <I>If God Were Alive Today</I>,  this last work is a brutal satire on societal ignorance and carefree  denial of the world&rsquo;s major problems. Protagonist Gil Berman is a  middle-aged college lecturer and self-declared stand-up comedian who  enjoys cracking jokes in front of a college audience while societal  dependence on fossil fuels has led to the apocalypse.

Then came the Clinton years and the invasion of the New American Ruling Class: New York hedge fund managers, Hollywood producers, and Silicon Valley billionaires. Almost overnight, real estate prices quadruple, horse pastures vanish, tuna tartare and arugula appear on every menu, and a Democratic congresswoman is elected by a landslide. The Old Guard aristocrats of yesterday are now irrelevant and the only power they have is keeping the Kornblatts out of their country club. Twelve characters with distinctly different voices tell their tales of lust and longing spanning the years from World War II to the present\u2013each story a piece of the jigsaw puzzle. The pieces all fit together until the secrets and lies, guarded for generations, are revealed, changing everything we thought was true about Rancho Esperanza and the people who live there.\r\n\r\nWritten as a novel in stories, Dori Carter\u2019s social satire gets into the hearts and souls of her characters, and presents a fresh look at our attitudes toward money and the ever-shifting nature of status in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Hardcover edition.", "isbn": "9781590513293", "language_code": "English", "awards": []}, "uuid": "aRWX5bM8rdsK5B6w6VDjFM", "annotation": ""},{"position": 51, "book": {"publisher": {"name": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "uuid": "mgiqkRVmdsaEkGeGuyRSFX"}, "author": "Joseph Epstein", "status": 1, "average_rating": 4.17, "title": "The Love Song of A.
