She explains how meat, fish, milk, and cheese\u2014the very foods we\u2019ve been taught to regard as the cornerstone of good nutrition\u2014are actually the culprits behind escalating rates of disease and the cause of dire, potentially permanent damage to our ecology.</p><p>Yet going meat- and dairy-free doesn\u2019t mean suffering deprivation; to the contrary, <i>The Kind Diet</i> introduces irresistibly delicious food that satisfies on every level\u2014it even includes amazing desserts to keep the most stubborn sweet tooth happy.
