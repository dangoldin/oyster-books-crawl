The colorful inhabitants and beautiful prose enrich a beautifully powerful ending.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe narrator of the story is a British journalist in India\u2013Kipling himself, in all but name. While on a tour of some Indian native states he meets two scruffy adventurers, Daniel Dravot and Peachey Carnehan. He rather likes them, but then stops them from blackmailing a minor rajah. A few months later they appear at his office in Lahore. They tell him their plan. They have been \"Soldier, sailor, compositor [typesetter], photographer... [railroad] engine-drivers, petty contractors,\" and more, and have decided India is not big enough for them. The next day they will go off to Kafiristan to set themselves up as kings. They plan to find a king or chief, help him defeat his enemies then take over for themselves. They ask the narrator for the use of any books or maps of the area\u2013as a favor, because they are fellow Freemasons, and because he spoiled their blackmail scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years later, on a scorching hot summer night, Carnehan creeps into the narrator's office. He is a broken man, a crippled beggar clad in rags and he tells an amazing story. Dravot and Carnehan succeeded in becoming kings: finding the Kafirs, who turn out to be white, mustering an army, taking over villages, and dreaming of building a unified nation. The Kafirs, who were pagans, not Muslims, acclaimed Dravot as a god (the reincarnation or descendant of Alexander the Great) because an arrow appeared to be unable to penetrate his chest in a battle, and because he wore a Masonic symbol associated with Alexander. The Kafirs practiced a form of Masonic ritual and the adventurers knew Masonic secrets that only the oldest priest remembered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir schemes were dashed when Dravot decided to marry a Kafir girl. Terrified at marrying a god, the girl bit Dravot when he tried to kiss her. Seeing him bleed, the priests cried that he was \"Neither God nor Devil but a man!\" Most of the Kafirs turned against Dravot and Carnehan. One chief and a few of his men remained loyal, but the army defected and the two kings were captured.\r\n\r\n\r\nDravot, wearing his crown, stood on a rope bridge over a gorge while the Kafirs cut the ropes, and he fell to his death. Carnehan was crucified between two pine trees. When he survived for a day, the Kafirs considered it a miracle and let him go. He begged his way back to India.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs proof of his tale, Carnehan shows the narrator Dravot's head, still wearing the golden crown. Carnehan leaves. The next day the narrator sees him crawling along the road in the noon sun, with his hat off and gone mad. The narrator sends him to the local asylum. When he inquires two days later, he learns that Carnehan has died of sunstroke.
