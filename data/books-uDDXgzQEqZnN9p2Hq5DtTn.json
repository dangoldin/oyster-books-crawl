It covers every aspect of U.S. history--politics; business and economics; art, literature and science; society and customs; complex traditions and religious beliefs. The story is told in terms of the men and women who shaped and led the nation and the ordinary people who collectively created its unique character. Wherever possible, letters, diaries, and recorded conversations are used to ensure a sense of actuality. \"The book has new and often trenchant things to say about every aspect and period of America's past,\" says Johnson, \"and I do not seek, as some historians do, to conceal my opinions.\" <p>Johnson's history presents John Winthrop, Roger Williams, Anne Hutchinson, Cotton Mather, Franklin, Tom Paine, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, and Madison from a fresh perspective. It emphasizes the role of religion in American history and how early America was linked to England's history and culture and includes incisive portraits of Andrew Jackson, Chief Justice Marshall, Clay, Lincoln, and Jefferson Davis. Johnson shows how Grover Cleveland and Teddy Roosevelt ushered in the age of big business and industry and how Woodrow Wilson revolutionized the government's role. He offers new views of Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover and of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and his role as commander in chief during World War II. An examination of the unforeseen greatness of Harry Truman and reassessments of Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Reagan, and Bush follow. \"Compulsively readable,\" said Foreign Affairs of Johnson's unique narrative skills and sharp profiles of people. <p>This is an in-depth portrait of a great people, from their fragile origins through their struggles for independence and nationhood, their heroic efforts and sacrifices to deal with the `organic sin' of slavery and the preservation of the Union to its explosive economic growth and emergence as a world power and its sole superpower. Johnson discusses such contemporary topics as the politics of racism, education, Vietnam, the power of the press, political correctness, the growth of litigation, and the rising influence of women. He sees Americans as a problem-solving people and the story of America as \"essentially one of difficulties being overcome by intelligence and skill, by faith and strength of purpose, by courage and persistence...Looking back on its past, and forward to its future, the auguries are that it will not disappoint humanity.\" <p>This challenging narrative and interpretation of American history by the author of many distinguished historical works is sometimes controversial and always provocative.

Bix", "uuid": "grJDUHkSmi888ZKJFfpakK", "description": "<h4 align=\"center\">Winner of the Pulitzer Prize</h4><p>In this groundbreaking biography of the Japanese emperor Hirohito, Herbert P. Bix offers the first complete, unvarnished look at the enigmatic leader whose sixty-three-year reign ushered Japan into the modern world. Never before has the full life of this controversial figure been revealed with such clarity and vividness. Bix shows what it was like to be trained from birth for a lone position at the apex of the nation's political hierarchy and as a revered symbol of divine status. Influenced by an unusual combination of the Japanese imperial tradition and a modern scientific worldview, the young emperor gradually evolves into his preeminent role, aligning himself with the growing ultranationalist movement, perpetuating a cult of religious emperor worship, resisting attempts to curb his power, and all the while burnishing his image as a reluctant, passive monarch. Here we see Hirohito as he truly was: a man of strong will and real authority.</p><p>Supported by a vast array of previously untapped primary documents, <em>Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan </em>is perhaps most illuminating in lifting the veil on the mythology surrounding the emperor's impact on the world stage. Focusing closely on Hirohito's interactions with his advisers and successive Japanese governments, Bix sheds new light on the causes of the China War in 1937 and the start of the Asia-Pacific War in 1941. And while conventional wisdom has had it that the nation's increasing foreign aggression was driven and maintained not by the emperor but by an elite group of Japanese militarists, the reality, as witnessed here, is quite different. Bix documents in detail the strong, decisive role Hirohito played in wartime operations, from the takeover of Manchuria in 1931 through the attack on Pearl Harbor and ultimately the fateful decision in 1945 to accede to an unconditional surrender. In fact, the emperor stubbornly prolonged the war effort and then used the horrifying bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together with the Soviet entrance into the war, as his exit strategy from a no-win situation. From the moment of capitulation, we see how American and Japanese leaders moved to justify the retention of Hirohito as emperor by whitewashing his wartime role and reshaping the historical consciousness of the Japanese people. The key to this strategy was Hirohito's alliance with General MacArthur, who helped him maintain his stature and shed his militaristic image, while MacArthur used the emperor as a figurehead to assist him in converting Japan into a peaceful nation. Their partnership ensured that the emperor's image would loom large over the postwar years and later decades, as Japan began to make its way in the modern age and struggled -- as it still does -- to come to terms with its past.</p><p>Until the very end of a career that embodied the conflicting aims of Japan's development as a nation, Hirohito remained preoccupied with politics and with his place in history. <em>Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan</em> provides the definitive account of his rich life and legacy. Meticulously researched and utterly engaging, this book is proof that the history of twentieth-century Japan cannot be understood apart from the life of its most remarkable and enduring leader.</p>", "isbn": "9780061860478", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/HarperCollins/9780061860478/1376527788.21.jpg", "oyster_summary": "", "average_rating": 3.73, "language_code": "eng", "awards": [{"image": null, "uuid": "8YMQPG32TB3yRipbSoRKZB", "name": "National Book Critics Circle Award Winner"}, {"image": null, "uuid": "F4B9gynsFCkRN5YRrFwRBM", "name": "Winner of the Pulitzer Prize"}], "title": "Hirohito And The Making Of Modern Japan", "publication_date": "2009-10-13", "number_print_pages": 832}, "position": 7, "uuid": "ByX23k85jcALzRNuZrVoY6", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"oyster_good_for_statement": "", "publisher": {"uuid": "2KAyLpyKhNvjq9gAmobD9", "name": "Verso"}, "status": 1, "author": "Seumas Milne", "uuid": "yMurhvY7cVEiya62qmhqMC", "description": "<p>From 9/11 to the Arab uprisings and beyond&mdash;encompassing the economic crisis, war on terror, rise of China and tide of change in Latin America&mdash;<em>The Revenge of History</em> turns the orthodoxies of the past generation on their head.</p><p>In this coruscating account of the first decade of the twenty-first century, Seumas Milne presents a powerful indictment of a US global and corporate empire in&mdash;and its British and European camp followers.

They set the fashions, encouraged the arts, and, in some cases, ruled nations. Eleanor Herman's Sex with Kings takes us into the throne rooms and bedrooms of Europe's most powerful monarchs. Alive with flamboyant characters, outrageous humor, and stirring poignancy, this glittering tale of passion and politics chronicles five hundred years of scintillating women and the kings who loved them.Curiously, the main function of a royal mistress was not to provide the king with sex but with companionship. Forced to marry repulsive foreign princesses, kings sought solace with women of their own choice. And what women they were! From Madame de Pompadour, the famous mistress of Louis XV, who kept her position for nineteen years despite her frigidity, to modern-day Camilla Parker-Bowles, who usurped none other than the glamorous Diana, Princess of Wales.The successful royal mistress made herself irreplaceable. She was ready to converse gaily with him when she was tired, make love until all hours when she was ill, and cater to his every whim. Wearing a mask of beaming delight over any and all discomforts, she was never to be exhausted, complaining, or grief-stricken.True, financial rewards for services rendered were of royal proportions -- some royal mistresses earned up to $200 million in titles, pensions, jewels, and palaces. Some kings allowed their mistresses to exercise unlimited political power. But for all its grandeur, a royal court was a scorpion's nest of insatiable greed, unquenchable lust, and vicious ambition. Hundreds of beautiful women vied to unseat the royal mistress. Many would suffer the slings and arrows of negative public opinion, some met with tragic ends and were pensioned off to make room for younger women. But the royal mistress often had the last laugh, as she lived well and richly off the fruits of her \"sins.\"From the dawn of time, power has been a mighty aphrodisiac. With diaries, personal letters, and diplomatic dispatches, Eleanor Herman's trailblazing research reveals the dynamics of sex and power, rivalry and revenge, at the most brilliant courts of Europe. Wickedly witty and endlessly entertaining, Sex with Kings is a chapter of women's history that has remained unwritten -- until now.", "isbn": "9780061751554", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/HarperCollins/9780061751554/1376505909.84.jpg", "oyster_summary": "", "average_rating": 3.7, "language_code": "eng", "awards": [], "title": "Sex with Kings", "publication_date": "2009-03-17", "number_print_pages": 320}, "position": 23, "uuid": "LMbKj9KqjSk65AoXQnV8oA", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"oyster_good_for_statement": "", "publisher": {"uuid": "ef6mgBa3njWeiz46odozni", "name": "HarperCollins"}, "status": 1, "author": "Kenneth C.

Arendt explores the institutions and operations of totalitarian movements, focusing on the two genuine forms of totalitarian government in our time&#8212;Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia&#8212;which she adroitly recognizes were two sides of the same coin, rather than opposing philosophies of Right and Left. From this vantage point, she discusses the evolution of classes into masses, the role of propaganda in dealing with the nontotalitarian world, the use of terror, and the nature of isolation and loneliness as preconditions for total domination.", "isbn": "9780547543154", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Houghton%20Mifflin%20Harcourt/9780547543154/1376381487.21.jpg", "oyster_summary": "", "average_rating": 4.17, "language_code": "eng", "awards": [], "title": "The Origins of Totalitarianism", "publication_date": "1973-03-21", "number_print_pages": 576}, "position": 22, "uuid": "XYSriumXNXag3uJBEED47V", "annotation": ""}]
