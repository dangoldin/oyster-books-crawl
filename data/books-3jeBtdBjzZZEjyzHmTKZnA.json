They are all versions of a bigger question: how do you live? How do you do the good or honorable thing, while flourishing and feeling happy?\r\n\r\nThis question obsessed Renaissance writers, none more than Michel Eyquem de Monatigne, perhaps the first truly modern individual. A nobleman, public official and wine-grower, he wrote free-roaming explorations of his thought and experience, unlike anything written before. He called them \u201cessays,\u201d meaning \u201cattempts\u201d or \u201ctries.\u201d Into them, he put whatever was in his head: his tastes in wine and food, his childhood memories, the way his dog\u2019s ears twitched when it was dreaming, as well as the appalling events of the religious civil wars raging around him. The Essays was an instant bestseller and, over four hundred years later, Montaigne\u2019s honesty and charm still draw people to him. Readers come in search of companionship, wisdom and entertainment\u2014and in search of themselves.\r\n\r\nThis book, a spirited and singular biography, relates the story of his life by way of the questions he posed and the answers he explored. It traces his bizarre upbringing, youthful career and sexual adventures, his travels, and his friendships with the scholar and poet \u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie and with his adopted \u201cdaughter,\u201d Marie de Gournay.
