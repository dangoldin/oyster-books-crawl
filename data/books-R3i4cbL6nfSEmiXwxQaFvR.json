Abrams", "description": "<P>In the course of fifty years, director Stanley Kubrick produced some of the most haunting and indelible images on film. His films touch on a wide range of topics rife with questions about human life, behavior, and emotions: love and sex, war, crime, madness, social conditioning, and technology. Within this great variety of subject matter, Kubrick examines different sides of reality and unifies them into a rich philosophical vision that is similar to existentialism. Perhaps more than any other philosophical concept, existentialism -- the belief that philosophical truth has meaning only if it is chosen by the individual -- has come down from the ivory tower to influence popular culture at large. In virtually all of Kubrick's films, the protagonist finds himself or herself in opposition to a hard and uncaring world, whether the conflict arises in the natural world or in human institutions. Kubrick's war films (Fear and Desire, Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, and Full Metal Jacket) examine how humans deal with their worst fears -- especially the fear of death -- when facing the absurdity of war. Full Metal Jacket portrays a world of physical and moral change, with an environment in continual flux in which attempting to impose order can be dangerous. The film explores the tragic consequences of an unbending moral code in a constantly changing universe. Essays in the volume examine Kubrick's interest in morality and fate, revealing a Stoic philosophy at the center of many of his films. Several of the contributors find his oeuvre to be characterized by skepticism, irony, and unfettered hedonism. In such films as A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick confronts the notion that we will struggle against our own scientific and technological innovations. Kubrick's films about the future posit that an active form of nihilism will allow humans to accept the emptiness of the world and push beyond it to form a free and creative view of humanity. Taken together, the essays in The Philosophy of Stanley Kubrick are an engaging look at the director's stark vision of a constantly changing moral and physical universe. They promise to add depth and complexity to the interpretation of Kubrick's signature films.</P>", "isbn": "9780813137193", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/The%20University%20Press%20of%20Kentucky/9780813137193/1377070917.58.jpg", "title": "The Philosophy of Stanley Kubrick", "publisher": {"uuid": "iuSURhCXJFGWkyZ8VQxgb", "name": "The University Press of Kentucky"}, "uuid": "MkPAWVrmzVdQZXz6ug8zQH", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "number_print_pages": 288, "oyster_summary": "", "status": 1, "publication_date": "2007-05-04", "language_code": "eng", "average_rating": 0.0}, "position": 0},{"annotation": "", "uuid": "y4SGAgBpuxEffpfWUHR2JE", "book": {"awards": [], "author": "Herbert Lieberman", "description": "<DIV><DIV><b>When a madman begins using the work of Botticelli as inspiration for his gruesome tableaus, a New York museum curator is the only man who can stop him</b></div><DIV><BR>Mike Manship is an up-and-coming curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

The story of these remarkable sisters &mdash; and their central role in shaping the thinking of their day &#8212; has never before been fully told. Twenty years in the making, Megan Marshall's monumental biograpy brings the era of creative ferment known as American Romanticism to new life. Elizabeth, the oldest sister, was a mind-on-fire thinker. A powerful influence on the great writers of the era &#8212; Emerson, Hawthorne, and Thoreau among them &#8212; she also published some of their earliest works. It was Elizabeth who prodded these newly minted Transcendentalists away from Emerson's individualism and toward a greater connection to others. Mary was a determined and passionate reformer who finally found her soul mate in the great educator Horace Mann. The frail Sophia was a painter who won the admiration of the preeminent society artists of the day. She married Nathaniel Hawthorne &#8212; but not before Hawthorne threw the delicate dynamics among the sisters into disarray. Marshall focuses on the moment when the Peabody sisters made their indelible mark on history. Her unprecedented research into these lives uncovered thousands of letters never read before as well as other previously unmined original sources. The Peabody Sisters casts new light on a legendary American era.

His friend Robert Reisner observed,  Parker, in the brief span of his life, crowded more living into it than any other human being.

This new biography artfully weaves together firsthand accounts from those who knew him with new information about his life and career to create a compelling narrative portrait of a tragic genius.   While other books about Parker have focused primarily on his music and recordings, this portrait reveals the troubled man behind the music, illustrating how his addictions and struggles with mental health affected his life and career. He was alternatively generous and miserly; a loving husband and father at home but an incorrigible philanderer on the road; and a chronic addict who lectured younger musicians about the dangers of drugs. Above all he was a musician, who overcame humiliation, disappointment, and a life-threatening car wreck to take wing as Bird, a brilliant improviser and composer.  With in-depth research into previously overlooked sources and illustrated with several never-before-seen images, Bird: The Life and Music of Charlie Parker corrects much of the misinformation and myth about one of the most influential musicians of the twentieth century.", "isbn": "9780252095177", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/University%20of%20Illinois%20Press/9780252095177/1379660794.57.jpg", "title": "Bird", "publisher": {"uuid": "kEZyg4HDgiScw6jmfVU3ee", "name": "University of Illinois Press"}, "uuid": "aBccGVjQEHYB7jEsmozh6Z", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "number_print_pages": 190, "oyster_summary": "", "status": 1, "publication_date": "2013-08-14", "language_code": "eng", "average_rating": 3.98}, "position": 6},{"annotation": "", "uuid": "gnDAuWTs8Hqx2gC7D4w3vZ", "book": {"awards": [], "author": "Mary Shelley", "description": "Mary Shelley began writing Frankenstein when she was only eighteen.
