A cyclist training for the Olympics, Jason is often abroad and unfaithful; Lauren, in turn, finds solace in Michel, a nightclub manager trying to reconnect with his past. Michel&rsquo;s journey leads to <i>The Death of Marat</i>, a recovered lost masterwork of silent film directed by his grandfather, whose extraordinary life includes having grown up as an orphaned twin in a Parisian brothel. In a world shaped by sensuality and trauma, where sandstorms invade Los Angeles, the Seine freezes, bike racers vanish in Venice, and relationships are warped by amnesia, geological chaos and personal upheaval each wrenchingly reflect the other.<BR></div></div>", "isbn": "9781480409927", "language_code": "eng", "awards": [{"name": "New York Times Bestseller", "image": null, "uuid": "TAR7ToA2sHGZVqtkLY9wC6"}], "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "oyster_summary": "", "publication_date": "2013-04-30", "number_print_pages": 253, "average_rating": 4.04, "title": "Days Between Stations", "uuid": "Ge527qJYUm3ZhXVzkPgJeG", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Open%20Road%20Media/Days%20Between%20Stations/1373336174.98.jpg", "publisher": {"name": "Open Road Media", "uuid": "M3vVhZgj8kLjFHReaifoaJ"}, "author": "Steve Erickson", "status": 1}, "uuid": "XcM4HVWkqdiBPkHENikkxn", "annotation": "The Guardian called Days Between Stations one of the best literary debuts ever.

With its profound sense of moral isolation and its compassionate glimpses into its characters' inner lives, the novel is considered McCullers' finest work, an enduring masterpiece first published by Houghton Mifflin in 1940. At its center is the deaf-mute John Singer, who becomes the confidant for various types of misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for escape from small town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane, Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's heroine (and loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her music. Wonderfully attuned to the spiritual isolation that underlies the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated -- and, through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal search for beauty.<br>     Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her ability \"to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness.\" She writes \"with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming,\" said the NEW YORK TIMES.
