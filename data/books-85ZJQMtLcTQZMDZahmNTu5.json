Taking us from fin-de-si&#232;cle Paris to Rat Pack-era Las Vegas, from wartime government labs to Yippie communes on the Pacific coast, Weatherall shows how physicists successfully brought their science to bear on some of the thorniest problems in economics, from options pricing to bubbles.<br><BR>The crisis was partly a failure of mathematical modeling.

That is essentially where public debate about the causes of the crisis began&mdash;and ended&mdash;in the month following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the 502-point fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in mid-September 2008. However, the subprime housing bubble is just one piece of the puzzle. Asset bubbles inflate and burst frequently, but severe worldwide recessions are rare. What was different this time?<br /><br />In <i>What Caused the Financial Crisis</i> leading economists and scholars delve into the major causes of the worst financial collapse since the Great Depression and, together, present a comprehensive picture of the factors that led to it. One essay examines the role of government regulation in expanding home ownership through mortgage subsidies for impoverished borrowers, encouraging the subprime housing bubble. Another explores how banks were able to securitize mortgages by manipulating criteria used for bond ratings. How this led to inaccurate risk assessments that could not be covered by sufficient capital reserves mandated under the Basel accords is made clear in a third essay. Other essays identify monetary policy in the United States and Europe, corporate pay structures, credit-default swaps, banks' leverage, and financial deregulation as possible causes of the crisis.<br /><br />With contributions from Richard A.

This transformation has been so spectacular that some have called it a miracle. How did it happen? Taking the reader from the docksides of Korea to the halls of India's finance ministry, <em>The Miracle</em> details the courageous decisions and heroic self-sacrifice that made Asia's ascent possible. Spanning nine countries and probing major historical currents, this account illuminates not only Asia's extraordinary economic rise but also how its causes might emancipate the developing world from poverty and guide the developed world to further prosperity. </p><p>Using more than a decade of reporting and analysis, <em>Time</em> magazine and former <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter Michael Schuman uncovers how outsourcing to Asia began; how Asia's most famous companies, such as Sony and Honda, became global corporations; and how technological changes and global economic shifts made Asia's boom possible. He reveals the compelling human side to this economic story, introducing readers to the political strongmen, entrepreneurs, and policymakers who made the Miracle a reality. This engaging historical narrative brings to life the ideas and actions of a diverse group of Asians&#8212;dictators and democrats, generals and technocrats, economists and engineers. </p><p>Some of the characters in the book have captured the global imagination for years, such as China's reformer Deng Xiaoping and Sony founder Akio Morita. Others are less well known, including Park Chung Hee, Korea's tightfisted nation builder; Liu Chuanzhi, the risk-taking founder of PC maker Lenovo; and Azim Premji, the mastermind behind Wipro, one of India's technology giants. All of them shared a dream&#8212;to elevate Asia to its proper place of influence in the world and eradicate the poverty around them. </p><p><em>The Miracle</em> not only offers profound insight into Asia and its increasing wealth and power; it also reveals how these seismic shifts continue to reverberate through the global economy. The implications of Asia's economic ascent for the rest of the world are surprising, promising, and inspiring. Readers of <em>The Miracle</em> will gain a deep understanding of Asia's place in the global economy&#8212;and of their own. </p>", "isbn": "9780061888083", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/HarperCollins/9780061888083/1376528240.98.jpg", "title": "The Miracle", "publisher": {"uuid": "ef6mgBa3njWeiz46odozni", "name": "HarperCollins"}, "uuid": "iuaUUag5uHpMxekZyEDysM", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "number_print_pages": 464, "oyster_summary": "", "status": 1, "publication_date": "2009-06-30", "language_code": "eng", "average_rating": 4.23}, "position": 1},{"annotation": "", "uuid": "5LnsiW57FwkM6YCy2XxuUh", "book": {"awards": [], "author": "John  Kenneth Galbraith", "description": "<DIV>John Kenneth Galbraith has long been at the center of American economics, in key positions of responsibility during the New Deal, World War II, and since, guiding policy and debate. His trenchant new book distills this lifetime of experience in the public and private sectors; it is a scathing critique of matters as they stand today.<BR>Sounding the alarm about the increasing gap between reality and \"conventional wisdom\" -- a phrase he coined -- Galbraith tells, along with much else, how we have reached a point where the private sector has unprecedented control over the public sector. We have given ourselves over to self-serving belief and \"contrived nonsense\" or, more simply, fraud. This has come at the expense of the economy, effective government, and the business world.<BR>Particularly noted is the central power of the corporation and the shift in authority from shareholders and board members to management. In an intense exercise of fraud, the pretense of shareholder power is still maintained, even with the immediate participants. In fact, because of the scale and complexity of the modern corporation, decisive power must go to management. From management and its own inevitable self-interest, power extends deeply into government -- the so-called public sector. This is particularly and dangerously the case in such matters as military policy, the environment, and, needless to say, taxation. Nevertheless, there remains the firm reference to the public sector.<BR>How can fraud be innocent? In his inimitable style, Galbraith offers the answer. His taut, wry, and severe comment is essential reading for everyone who cares about America's future.
