In contrast to her daughters, French children feed themselves neatly and happily&#8212;eating everything from beets to broccoli, salad to spinach, mussels to muesli.

Soon, the family cures picky eating and learns to love trying new foods.

The result is a family food revolution with surprising but happy results&#8212;which suggest we need to dramatically rethink the way we feed children, at home and at school.</p>", "oyster_good_for_statement": ""}, "position": 14, "annotation_html": "Part memoir, part food manifesto, Karen Le Billon describes the year she and her family moved to France, shed bad American habits (like snacking), and became more adventurous, healthy eaters \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise.", "uuid": "7UeBCB7eqWguwpMtD4mdrF", "annotation": "Part memoir, part food manifesto, Karen Le Billon describes the year she and her family moved to France, shed bad American habits (like snacking), and became more adventurous, healthy eaters \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise."}]
