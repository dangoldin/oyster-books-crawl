Through the experiences of five families, all of them residents of 97 Orchard Street, she takes readers on a vivid and unforgettable tour, from impossibly cramped tenement apartments down dimly lit stairwells where children played and neighbors socialized, beyond the front stoops where immigrant housewives found respite and company, and out into the hubbub of the dirty, teeming streets.</p><p>Ziegelman shows how immigrant cooks brought their ingenuity to the daily task of feeding their families, preserving traditions from home but always ready to improvise. While health officials worried that pushcarts were unsanitary and that pickles made immigrants too excitable to be good citizens, a culinary revolution was taking place in the streets of what had been culturally an English city. Along the East River, German immigrants founded breweries, dispensing their beloved lager in the dozens of beer gardens that opened along the Bowery. Russian Jews opened tea parlors serving blintzes and strudel next door to Romanian nightclubs that specialized in goose pastrami. On the streets, Italian peddlers hawked the cheese-and-tomato pies known as <em>pizzarelli</em>, while Jews sold knishes and squares of halvah. Gradually, as Americans began to explore the immigrant ghetto, they uncovered the array of comestible enticements of their foreign-born neighbors. <em>97 Orchard</em> charts this exciting process of discovery as it lays bare the roots of our collective culinary heritage.</p>", "isbn": "9780061997907", "language_code": "eng", "awards": [], "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "oyster_summary": "", "publication_date": "2010-06-01", "number_print_pages": 272, "average_rating": 3.67, "title": "97 Orchard", "uuid": "EortxE5Gh6Vvwuzw2mgUJU", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/HarperCollins/9780061997907/1378009449.49.jpg", "publisher": {"name": "HarperCollins", "uuid": "ef6mgBa3njWeiz46odozni"}, "author": "Jane Ziegelman", "status": 1}, "uuid": "6oaFfNdfD6u9rEoSgGHxrg", "annotation": ""},{"position": 50, "book": {"description": "<P><I>Frontier</I>: the word carries the inevitable scent of the West.

It covers every aspect of U.S. history--politics; business and economics; art, literature and science; society and customs; complex traditions and religious beliefs. The story is told in terms of the men and women who shaped and led the nation and the ordinary people who collectively created its unique character.

It emphasizes the role of religion in American history and how early America was linked to England's history and culture and includes incisive portraits of Andrew Jackson, Chief Justice Marshall, Clay, Lincoln, and Jefferson Davis. Johnson shows how Grover Cleveland and Teddy Roosevelt ushered in the age of big business and industry and how Woodrow Wilson revolutionized the government's role. He offers new views of Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover and of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and his role as commander in chief during World War II.

Johnson discusses such contemporary topics as the politics of racism, education, Vietnam, the power of the press, political correctness, the growth of litigation, and the rising influence of women.

His name was Martin Luther King Jr., but where did this young minister come from? What did he believe, and what role would he play in the growing activism of the civil rights movement of the 1950s? In Becoming King: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Making of a National Leader, author Troy Jackson chronicles King's emergence and effectiveness as a civil rights leader by examining his relationship with the people of Montgomery, Alabama. Using the sharp lens of Montgomery's struggle for racial equality to investigate King's burgeoning leadership, Jackson explores King's ability to connect with the educated and the unlettered, professionals and the working class. In particular, Jackson highlights King's alliances with Jo Ann Robinson, a young English professor at Alabama State University; E. D. Nixon, a middle-aged Pullman porter and head of the local NAACP chapter; and Virginia Durr, a courageous white woman who bailed Rosa Parks out of jail after Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white person. Jackson offers nuanced portrayals of King's relationships with these and other civil rights leaders in the community to illustrate King's development within the community. Drawing on countless interviews and archival sources, Jackson compares King's sermons and religious writings before, during, and after the Montgomery bus boycott. Jackson demonstrates how King's voice and message evolved during his time in Montgomery, reflecting the shared struggles, challenges, experiences, and hopes of the people with whom he worked. Many studies of the civil rights movement end analyses of Montgomery's struggle with the conclusion of the bus boycott and the establishment of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Jackson surveys King's uneasy post-boycott relations with E. D. Nixon and Rosa Parks, shedding new light on Parks's plight in Montgomery after the boycott and revealing the internal discord that threatened the movement's hard-won momentum. The controversies within the Montgomery Improvement Association compelled King to position himself as a national figure who could rise above the quarrels within the movement and focus on attaining its greater goals. Though the Montgomery struggle thrust King into the national spotlight, the local impact on the lives of blacks from all socioeconomic classes was minimal at the time. As the citizens of Montgomery awaited permanent change, King left the city, taking the lessons he learned there onto the national stage. In the crucible of Montgomery, Martin Luther King Jr. was transformed from an inexperienced Baptist preacher into a civil rights leader of profound national importance.</P>", "isbn": "9780813138671", "language_code": "eng", "awards": [], "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "oyster_summary": "", "publication_date": "2009-12-01", "number_print_pages": 248, "average_rating": 4.01, "title": "Becoming King", "uuid": "6zyPYejcKLzBR4kkWZ78ae", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/The%20University%20Press%20of%20Kentucky/9780813138671/1377070915.29.jpg", "publisher": {"name": "The University Press of Kentucky", "uuid": "iuSURhCXJFGWkyZ8VQxgb"}, "author": "Troy Jackson", "status": 1}, "uuid": "JzJcj2okrC5eji6R445sLY", "annotation": ""},{"position": 52, "book": {"description": "<p>This \"masterful treatment of one of the most complex periods of American history\" (<em>New Republic</em>) made history when it was originally published in 1988.
