There is also an astonishing contextualization of Don Quixote and Sancho in Grossman's translation that I believe has not been achieved before. The spiritual atmosphere of a Spain already in steep decline can be felt throughout, thanks to her heightened quality of diction. <p></p><p>Grossman might be called the Glenn Gould of translators, because she, too, articulates every note. Reading her amazing mode of finding equivalents in English for Cervantes's darkening vision is an entrance into a further understanding of why this great book contains within itself all the novels that have followed in its sublime wake.\" </p><p>From the Introduction by Harold Bloom </p></blockquote><p></p><p>Miguel de Cervantes was born on September 29, 1547, in Alcala de Henares, Spain. At twenty-three he enlisted in the Spanish militia and in 1571 fought against the Turks in the battle of Lepanto, where a gunshot wound permanently crippled his left hand. He spent four more years at sea and then another five as a slave after being captured by Barbary pirates. Ransomed by his family, he returned to Madrid but his disability hampered him; it was in debtor's prison that he began to write <em>Don Quixote.</em> Cervantes wrote many other works, including poems and plays, but he remains best known as the author of <em>Don Quixote.</em> He died on April 23, 1616. </p>", "average_rating": 3.8, "author": "Miguel de Cervantes", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/HarperCollins/9780061957888/1376452618.47.jpg"}},{"annotation": "", "uuid": "6Y5jb85aHx8ibPEtz7k7bF", "position": 1, "book": {"uuid": "5WYCZFRMTb3sV7saaHNiXW", "status": 1, "oyster_summary": "", "language_code": "eng", "number_print_pages": 224, "title": "Seven Years with Banksy", "publication_date": "2012-09-01", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "isbn": "9781843178934", "publisher": {"uuid": "HzMw4PbXvrWowxnrUYKoLm", "name": "Michael O'Mara"}, "awards": [], "description": "<DIV><B>A personal and in-depth account of the enigmatic&#160;man behind the murals, written by a friend and fan</B></div><DIV><I></I>&#160;</DIV><DIV>An illuminating memoir of the world's most celebrated graffiti artist,&#160;this book offers insight into&#160;Banksy's life and work through the experiences that he and the author Robert Clarke shared together during Banksy's formative years.
