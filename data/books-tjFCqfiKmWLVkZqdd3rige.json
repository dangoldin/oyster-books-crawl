Drawing on hundreds of interviews and previously untapped sources, this first major biography of one of the most romanticized icons in jazz gives a thrilling account of the trumpeter&#8217;s dark journey. Author James Gavin delves deeply into Baker&#8217;s tormented childhood, the origins of his melancholic trumpet playing, and even reveals the long-unsolved riddle of Baker&#8217;s demise. Baker&#8217;s otherworldly personal aura struck a note of menace and mystery that catapulted him to fame in the staid 1950s but as time wore on, his romance with drugs became highly publicized. Gavin narrates the harrowing spiral of dependency down which Baker tumbled and illustrates how those who dared to get close were dragged down with him.

Growing up on a ranch in Sterling, Colorado, Frederick Libby mastered the cowboy arts of roping, punching cattle, and taming horses. As a young man he exercised his skills in the mountains and on the ranges of Arizona and New Mexico as well as the Colorado prairie. When World War I broke out, he found himself in Calgary, Alberta, and joined the Canadian army. In France, he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps as an \"observer,\" the gunner in a two-person biplane. Libby shot down an enemy plane on his first day in battle over the Somme, which was also the first day he flew in a plane or fired a machine gun. He went on to become a pilot. He fought against the legendary German aces Oswald Boelcke and Manfred von Richthofen, and became the first American to down five enemy planes. He won the Military Cross for conspicuous gallantry in action.   Libby\u2019s memoir of his cowboy days in the last years of the Old West evokes a real-life Cormac McCarthy novel. His description of World War I combines a rattling good account of the air war over France with captivating and sometimes poignant depictions of wartime London, the sorrow for friends lost in combat, and the courage and camaraderie of the Royal Flying Corps.

The story of these remarkable sisters &mdash; and their central role in shaping the thinking of their day &#8212; has never before been fully told. Twenty years in the making, Megan Marshall's monumental biograpy brings the era of creative ferment known as American Romanticism to new life. Elizabeth, the oldest sister, was a mind-on-fire thinker. A powerful influence on the great writers of the era &#8212; Emerson, Hawthorne, and Thoreau among them &#8212; she also published some of their earliest works. It was Elizabeth who prodded these newly minted Transcendentalists away from Emerson's individualism and toward a greater connection to others. Mary was a determined and passionate reformer who finally found her soul mate in the great educator Horace Mann. The frail Sophia was a painter who won the admiration of the preeminent society artists of the day. She married Nathaniel Hawthorne &#8212; but not before Hawthorne threw the delicate dynamics among the sisters into disarray. Marshall focuses on the moment when the Peabody sisters made their indelible mark on history. Her unprecedented research into these lives uncovered thousands of letters never read before as well as other previously unmined original sources. The Peabody Sisters casts new light on a legendary American era.

Their showdown in Reykjavik, Iceland, held the world spellbound for two months with reports of psychological warfare, ultimatums, political intrigue, cliffhangers, and farce to rival a Marx Brothers film. </p><p>Thirty years later, David Edmonds and John Eidinow, authors of the national bestseller <em>Wittgenstein&#8217;s Poker</em>, have set out to reexamine the story we recollect as the quintessential cold war clash between a lone American star and the Soviet chess machine&#8212;a machine that had delivered the world title to the Kremlin for decades. Drawing upon unpublished Soviet and U.S. records, the authors reconstruct the full and incredible saga, one far more poignant and layered than hitherto believed. </p><p>Against the backdrop of superpower politics, the authors recount the careers and personalities of Boris Spassky, the product of Stalin&#8217;s imperium, and Bobby Fischer, a child of post-World War II America, an era of economic boom at home and communist containment abroad. The two men had nothing in common but their gift for chess, and the disparity of their outlook and values conditioned the struggle over the board.</p><p>Then there was the match itself, which produced both creative masterpieces and some of the most improbable gaffes in chess history. And finally, there was the dramatic and protracted off-the-board battle&#8212;in corridors and foyers, in back rooms and hotel suites, in Moscow offices and in the White House. </p><p>The authors chronicle how Fischer, a manip-ulative, dysfunctional genius, risked all to seize control of the contest as the organizers maneuvered frantically to save it&#8212;under the eyes of the world&#8217;s press. They can now tell the inside story of Moscow&#8217;s response, and the bitter tensions within the Soviet camp as the anxious and frustrated apparatchiks strove to prop up Boris Spassky, the most un-Soviet of their champions&#8212;fun-loving, sensitive, and a free spirit. Edmonds and Eidinow follow this careering, behind-the-scenes confrontation to its climax: a clash that displayed the cultural differences between the dynamic, media-savvy representatives of the West and the baffled, impotent Soviets. Try as they might, even the KGB couldn&#8217;t help.</p><p>A mesmerizing narrative of brilliance and triumph, hubris and despair, <em>Bobby Fischer Goes to War</em> is a biting deconstruction of the Bobby Fischer myth, a nuanced study on the art of brinkmanship, and a revelatory cold war tragicomedy. </p>", "isbn": "9780062039248", "language_code": "eng", "awards": [], "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "oyster_summary": "", "publication_date": "2011-08-23", "number_print_pages": 384, "average_rating": 3.87, "title": "Bobby Fischer Goes to War", "uuid": "yUJhL9VtFbxjvQdtMXQNWB", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/HarperCollins/9780062039248/1376531121.6.jpg", "publisher": {"name": "HarperCollins", "uuid": "ef6mgBa3njWeiz46odozni"}, "author": "David Edmonds", "status": 1}, "uuid": "xcgYv3SCsL2hJeMmsJMyFG", "annotation": ""},{"position": 32, "book": {"description": "<DIV>Drawing from interviews conducted before Marvin Gaye's death, acclaimed music writer David Ritz has created a full-scale portrait of the brilliant but tormented artist.

Forest rangers had assembled nearly ten thousand men to fight the fires, but no living person had seen anything like those flames, and neither the rangers nor anyone else knew how to subdue them. Egan recreates the struggles of the overmatched rangers against the implacable fire with unstoppable dramatic force, and the larger story of outsized president Teddy Roosevelt and his chief forester, Gifford Pinchot, that follows is equally resonant. Pioneering the notion of conservation, Roosevelt and Pinchot did nothing less than create the idea of public land as our national treasure, owned by every citizen. Even as TR's national forests were smoldering they were saved: The heroism shown by his rangers turned public opinion permanently in favor of the forests, though it changed the mission of the forest service in ways we can still witness today.  <p>This e-book includes a sample chapter of SHORT NIGHTS OF THE SHADOW CATCHER.", "isbn": "9780547416861", "language_code": "eng", "awards": [{"name": "National Book Award Winner", "image": null, "uuid": "CVnhErxt74qgQNyD84ZsLb"}, {"name": "New York Times Bestseller", "image": null, "uuid": "TAR7ToA2sHGZVqtkLY9wC6"}], "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "oyster_summary": "", "publication_date": "2009-10-19", "number_print_pages": 336, "average_rating": 4.03, "title": "The Big Burn", "uuid": "opvGGQxrV4bdQpy7rFiziA", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Houghton%20Mifflin%20Harcourt/9780547416861/1392100341.13.jpg", "publisher": {"name": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "uuid": "mgiqkRVmdsaEkGeGuyRSFX"}, "author": "Timothy Egan", "status": 1}, "uuid": "XjGRpDhr9XVB8xo3KZ7Nsi", "annotation": ""},{"position": 28, "book": {"description": "Acclaimed by leading historians and critics when it appeared shortly after the death of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., this foundational biography wends through the corridors in which King held court, posing the right questions and providing a keen measure of the man whose career and mission enthrall scholars and general readers to this day.
