The world of the circus: to Jacob it was both salvation and a living hell.<br /><br /> Jacob was there because his luck had run out\u2014orphaned and penniless, he had no direction until he landed on this locomotive \"ship of fools.\" It was the early part of the Great Depression, and everyone in this third-rate circus was lucky to have any job at all. Marlena, the star of the equestrian act, was there because she fell in love with the wrong man, a handsome circus boss with a wide mean streak. And Rosie the elephant was there because she was the great gray hope, the new act that was going to be the salvation of the circus; the only problem was, Rosie didn't have an act\u2014in fact, she couldn't even follow instructions.

Once these countries were saddled with huge debts, the American government and the international aid agencies allied with it were able, by dictating repayment terms, to essentially control their economies.

They referred to themselves as \"economic hit men.\"\nThis is a story of international political intrigue at the highest levels. For over a decade Perkins traveled all over the world--Indonesia, Panama, Ecuador, Columbia, Saudi Arabia, Iran--and worked with men like Panamanian president Omar Torrijos, who became a personal friend. He helped implement a secret scheme that funneled billions of Saudi petrodollars back into the U. S. economy, and that further cemented the intimate relationship between the Islamic fundamentalist House of Saud and a succession of American administrations. Perkins' story illuminates just how far economic hit men were willing to go, and unveils the real causes of some of the most dramatic developments in recent history, such as the fall of the Shah of Iran and the invasions of Panama and Iraq. Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, which many people urged Perkins not to write, is a blistering attack on a little-known phenomenon that has had dire consequences for both the lesser-developed countries and for American democracy.", "oyster_good_for_statement": ""}, "position": 27, "uuid": "Y9HBzFBkA8zcMkpE2P9wdb", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"author": "Lionel Shriver", "publication_date": "2010-03-09", "oyster_summary": "", "status": 1, "language_code": "eng", "number_print_pages": 480, "title": "So Much for That", "uuid": "wkkfeTYXLHmMZ4EZDNouWA", "awards": [{"name": "National Book Award Finalist", "uuid": "eYKvqpafcTyqyGvFx3Mrj4", "image": null}], "publisher": {"name": "HarperCollins", "uuid": "ef6mgBa3njWeiz46odozni"}, "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/HarperCollins/9780061978494/1376452762.1.jpg", "average_rating": 3.66, "isbn": "9780061978494", "description": "<blockquote><p>From the acclaimed author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Post-Birthday World</em> comes a searing, ruthlessly honest new novel about a marriage both stressed and strengthened by the demands of serious illness.</p></blockquote><p>Shep Knacker has long saved for \"The Afterlife\": an idyllic retreat to the Third World where his nest egg can last forever.

When the truth came out, Chris was released from prison, married Terry&#8212;pregnant with his child&#8212;and changed his last name to Donatti. He also became a professional killer.</p><p>Peter Decker was the detective on the case, and over the years, he and Terry kept in touch. Now his friend is in L.A. and asking for a favor. Though Decker knows full well that getting involved will bring Terry's sociopathic husband back into his life, the obsessive and duty-bound LAPD lieutenant reluctantly agrees. The favor soon becomes complicated when Terry goes missing and Donatti disappears, leaving their fourteen-year-old son, Gabe, with no one to turn to except Decker and his wife, Rina Lazarus. </p><p>But Peter's search for Terry must share center stage with a gruesome murder. Adrianna Blanc, a neonatal nurse at St. Timothy's Hospital, had signed off her night shift at eight a.m. Six hours later, a foreman supervising the construction of a house in a nearby suburb discovered her body swinging from the rafters, a cable wire around her neck. Her car was found where she had parked it the night before, with no signs of foul play. </p><p>A dedicated and conscientious professional, Adrianna had a circle of close friends. Yet as Decker and his able team soon learn, the young woman also had her share of detractors. A party-hearty girl, she enjoyed booze, kinky sex, and revenge-cheating on her boyfriend, Garth Hammerling, another nurse at St. Tim's. Suspicions heat up when Decker and his team find that one of Adrianna's last phone calls was a provocative and disturbing message to her vacationing boyfriend&#8212;who himself has vanished without a trace. Was Adrianna's death something personal because of her carefree lifestyle? Or was this unusually cruel and very dramatic murder the first signs of a serial killer? With lives hanging in the balance, Decker and his colleagues, Sergeant Marge Dunn and Detective Scott Oliver, need to find answers and fast. </p><p>As if juggling two investigations weren't enough for the lieutenant (not to mention turning sixty!), things are becoming even more dangerous with his precarious home life. Ever the concerned parent, Decker wants to look after Terry's son, Gabe. Yet who will protect his own family? Because if there's one thing he knows for sure, with a sociopath like Donatti on the loose, no one is ever really safe.</p>", "oyster_good_for_statement": ""}, "position": 40, "uuid": "uhTvvGKVPsrtJEkbJoWE2E", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"author": "Cynthia Freeman", "publication_date": "2013-08-27", "oyster_summary": "", "status": 1, "language_code": "eng", "number_print_pages": 381, "title": "Always and Forever", "uuid": "7Ba4NujswHziKbsjPjEF8B", "awards": [{"name": "New York Times Bestseller", "uuid": "TAR7ToA2sHGZVqtkLY9wC6", "image": null}], "publisher": {"name": "Open Road Media", "uuid": "M3vVhZgj8kLjFHReaifoaJ"}, "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Open%20Road%20Media/9781480435667/1377118528.33.jpg", "average_rating": 3.66, "isbn": "9781480435667", "description": "<DIV><DIV><b>This luminous novel by <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Cynthia Freeman weaves a vivid tapestry of war, family, and a love that transcends the ravages of time </b></div><DIV><BR>When Brooklyn-born Barnard graduate Kathy Ross travels to post&ndash;World War II Berlin to help displaced refugees, she never expects to fall instantly, irrevocably in love.

Then the Great War intervenes.<BR><BR>Half a century later, in August of 1964, Alessandro, a white-haired professor, still tall and proud, finds himself unexpectedly on the road with an illiterate young factory worker.

A wanderer in the hell that claimed Europe. And how he tragically lost one family and gained another.<br><BR>The boy is dazzled by the action and envious of the richness and color of the story, and realizes that the old man's magnificent tale of love and war is more than a tale: it is the recapitulation of his life, his reckoning with mortality, and above all, a love song for his family.</DIV> <div>&#160;</DIV> <div>This e-book includes a sample chapter of IN SUNLIGHT AND IN SHADOW.</DIV>", "oyster_good_for_statement": ""}, "position": 70, "uuid": "icazDvmsGgXZ6pYmJRhcFm", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"author": "Kim Barnouin", "publication_date": "2005-12-27", "oyster_summary": "", "status": 1, "language_code": "eng", "number_print_pages": 224, "title": "Skinny Bitch", "uuid": "WzmdxrKpqcfg7QqfrGAafL", "awards": [], "publisher": {"name": "Running Press", "uuid": "a5GdgELksZ9HP862ABnbHj"}, "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Running%20Press/9780762432752/1387370845.41.jpg", "average_rating": 3.18, "isbn": "9780762432752", "description": "<DIV>Not your typical boring diet book, this is a tart-tongued, no-holds-barred wakeup call to all women who want to be thin.
