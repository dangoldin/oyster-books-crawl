At its center is the deaf-mute John Singer, who becomes the confidant for various types of misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for escape from small town life.

Wonderfully attuned to the spiritual isolation that underlies the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated -- and, through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal search for beauty.<br>     Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her ability \"to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness.\" She writes \"with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming,\" said the NEW YORK TIMES.

While previous versions have softened the robust, and sometimes shocking, quality of Tolstoy's writing, Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky have produced a translation true to his powerful voice. This award-winning team's authoritative edition also includes an illuminating introduction and explanatory notes. Beautiful, vigorous, and eminently readable, this \"Anna Karenina\" will be the definitive text for generations to come. \r\n\"Pevear and Volokhonsky are at once scrupulous translators and vivid stylists of English, and their superb rendering allows us, as perhaps never before, to grasp the palpability of Tolstoy's 'characters, acts, situations.'\" \u2014 James Woods, The New Yorker", "isbn": "9781629450056", "language_code": "", "awards": [{"name": "PEN Translation Prize Winner", "image": null, "uuid": "zgY7JFywCRfAuspw5RcbET"}], "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "oyster_summary": "", "publication_date": "1877-01-01", "number_print_pages": 864, "average_rating": 3.98, "title": "Anna Karenina", "uuid": "x2P6oohLtgeA9ukRStZF4b", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Oyster/642/6421355520923.42.png", "publisher": {"name": "Oyster", "uuid": "ABL9TuZsJ5ThMeAYb933uA"}, "author": "Leo Tolstoy", "status": 1}, "uuid": "LcaV6AJcEvQus7zmcCfJeR", "annotation": ""},{"position": 23, "book": {"description": "In their own voices, women show how to strengthen your relationship-with surprising revelations from <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Gary Neuman<p>This breakthrough book, based on the voices of real women from all walks of life and groundbreaking new research, shows couples how to grow stronger by understanding what women need from a romantic relationship.

In this book, Mark invites readers to explore their own inner core through the stories of ordinary people, political activists, artists, spiritual teachers from a variety of traditions. These are people who have faced themselves, their warts and weaknesses. They have stood by the courage of their convictions in all kinds of moments, great and small. Nepo\u2019s insights and commentary are spot on, and help readers relate the stories of others to their own lives. The book is divided into three sections--finding our inner core, standing by our inner core, and sustaining the practice of living from that place. Each of the nearly 60 brief essays and stories elucidates and inspires. Nepo\u2019s broad range of stories and people, of traditions and insights, offers myriad ways for readers to relate to their own search for courage. The late Howard Zinn said of this book, \u201cA poetic, profoundly thoughtful rumination on how we might live.\u201d *This book was originally published by Conari Press in 2007 under the title Facing the Lion, Being the Lion.
