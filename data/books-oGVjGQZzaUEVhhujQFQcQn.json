Now she returns to the sea to search out the darker side of those lights, detailing the secret history of shipwrecks and the predatory scavengers who live off the spoils.  Even today, Britain's coastline remains a dangerous place. An island soaked by four separate seas, with shifting sand banks to the east, veiled reefs to the west, powerful currents above, and the world's busiest shipping channel below, the country's offshore waters are strewn with shipwrecks. For villagers scratching out an existence along Britain's shores, those wrecks have been more than simply an act of God; in many cases, they have been the difference between living well and just getting by. Though Daphne Du Maurier made Cornwall Britain's most notorious region for wrecking, many other coastal communities regarded the \"sea's bounty\" as an impromptu way of providing themselves with everything from grapefruits to grand pianos. Some plunderers were held to be so skilled that they could strip a ship from stem to stern before the Coast Guard had even left port, some were rumored to lure ships onto the rocks with false lights, and some simply waited for winter gales to do their work.  From all around Britain, Bathurst has uncovered the hidden history of ships and shipwreck victims, from shoreline orgies so Dionysian that few participants survived the morning to humble homes fitted with silver candelabra, from coastlines rigged like stage sets to villages where everyone owns identical tennis shoes. Spanning three hundred years of history, The Wreckers examines the myths, the realities, and the superstitions of shipwrecks and uncovers the darker side of life on Britain's shores.</div>", "isbn": "9780544301610", "title": "The Wreckers", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Houghton%20Mifflin%20Harcourt/9780544301610/1378365837.99.jpg", "publisher": {"uuid": "mgiqkRVmdsaEkGeGuyRSFX", "name": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"}, "awards": [], "language_code": "eng", "publication_date": "2013-08-23"}, "annotation": "", "position": 4},{"uuid": "Eh3HUniRNSjHXKKBFK6FRY", "book": {"uuid": "5EnPxCfNs24LCBT7hguZVj", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "author": "Terry Pratchett", "status": 1, "average_rating": 3.63, "oyster_summary": "", "number_print_pages": 256, "description": "<I>In the beginning, there was nothing but endless flatness.

With a son born to them, Gwendolyn and Thorgrin\u2019s lives are changed forever, as is the destiny of the Ring.\r\n\r\nThor is tasked with rebuilding the Legion. He deepens his training with Argon, and he is given an honor greater than he ever dreamed of when he is inducted into the Silver and becomes a Knight. Before departing the Ring to find his mother, Thor prepares first for his wedding with Gwendolyn. But events coincide which might just get in the way.\r\n\r\nGwendolyn is reeling from the birth of her son, the imminent departure of her husband, and the death of her mother. The Ring gathers for the royal funeral, which brings together the estranged sisters, Luanda and Gwendolyn, in one final confrontation that will have dire implications. Argon\u2019s prophecies ring in her head, and Gwendolyn feels a looming danger to the Ring, and furthers her plans to rescue all of her people from catastrophe.\r\n\r\nErec receives news of his father\u2019s illness, and is summoned back home, to the Southern Isles; Alistair joins him on the journey, as their wedding plans are put in motion. Kendrick seeks out his long-lost mother, and is shocked at who he finds. Conven returns to his home towns to find things are not what he expects, and he falls deeper into mourning. Steffen unexpectedly finds love, while Sandara surprises Kendrick by wanting to leave the Ring for her homeland in the Empire.\r\n\r\nReece, despite himself, falls in love with his cousin, and when Tirus\u2019 sons find out, they set in motion a great treachery.

The McCloud side of the Highlands are equally unstable, with a civil war on the verge of breaking out.\r\n\r\nRomulus, in the Empire, discovers a new form of magic which may just destroy the Shield for good. He forges a deal with the dark side and, emboldened with a power that not even Argon can stop, Romulus initiates a sure way to destroy the Ring.\r\n\r\nWith its sophisticated world-building and characterization, A SEA OF SHIELDS is an epic tale of friends and lovers, of rivals and suitors, of knights and dragons, of intrigues and political machinations, of coming of age, of broken hearts, of deception, ambition and betrayal. It is a tale of honor and courage, of fate and destiny, of sorcery.

It\u2019s a truth that body-builders and top athletes have known for years but scientists are now confirming that fasting accelerates fat loss and shifts weight from stubborn areas too. What\u2019s more, you\u2019ll find that you sleep better, have more energy, slow down your ageing and even improve your long-standing health problems through fine-tuning your body\u2019s repair mechanisms.</p>\r\n<p>Amanda Hamilton\u2019s Eat, Fast, Slim contains a choice of diet plans which allow you to tailor the diet according to your lifestyle and \u2018weight-loss personality\u2019. You can choose Plan A, a daily fast of 16 hours (so you\u2019ll skip either dinner or breakfast), starting with once a week and working up to more frequent fasts. Or you can follow Plan B, a full day fast, twice a week, during which you\u2019ll eat one evening meal. But there\u2019s freedom in the plans so you can graze, rather than sitting down to main meals, and you can of course add an exercise element to your routine whilst fasting. On top of this, you can follow Plan C to enhance the fasts with juicing and other boosting techniques. </p>\r\n<p>Interspersed throughout the book, Amanda tells the story of how she found her way to IF, from her introduction to fasting on a meditation retreat in the Himalayas to her work with the system in her weight-loss clinic. She reveals the latest scientific findings that support the physical, mental and spiritual benefits of structured fasting, describes how the plans were created, and the results that the reader can expect.

In the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s he was the country&#8217;s highest-paid entertainer and its most enigmatic. He was notoriously inscrutable, as mercurial (and sometimes cruel) off-camera as he was charming and hilarious onstage. During the apex of his reign, Carson&#8217;s longtime lawyer and best friend was Henry Bushkin, who now shows us Johnny Carson with a breathtaking clarity and depth that nobody else could.<br><BR>From the moment in 1970 when Carson hired Bushkin (who was just twenty-seven) until the moment eighteen years later when they parted ways, the author witnessed and often took part in a string of escapades that still retain their power to surprise and fascinate us. One of Bushkin&#8217;s first assignments was helping Carson break into a posh Manhattan apartment to gather evidence of his wife&#8217;s infidelity. More than once, Bushkin helped his client avoid entanglements with the mob. Of course, Carson&#8217;s adventures weren&#8217;t all so sordid. He hosted Ronald Reagan&#8217;s inaugural concert as a favor to the new president, and he prevented a drunken Dean Martin from appearing onstage that evening. Carson socialized with Frank Sinatra, Jack Lemmon, Jimmy Stewart, Kirk Douglas, and dozens of other boldface names who populate this atmospheric and propulsive chronicle of the King of Late Night and his world.<br><BR>But this memoir isn&#8217;t just dishy. It is a tautly rendered and remarkably nuanced portrait of Carson, revealing not only how he truly was, but why. Bushkin explains why Carson, a voracious (and very talented) womanizer, felt he always had to be married; why he loathed small talk even as he excelled at it; why he couldn&#8217;t visit his son in the hospital and wouldn&#8217;t attend his mother&#8217;s funeral; and much more. Bushkin&#8217;s account is by turns shocking, poignant, and uproarious &#8212; written with a novelist&#8217;s eye for detail, a screenwriter&#8217;s ear for dialogue, and a knack for comic timing that Carson himself would relish. <I>Johnny Carson</I> unveils not only the hidden Carson, but also the raucous, star-studded world he ruled.<br></DIV>", "isbn": "9780544217737", "title": "Johnny Carson", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Houghton%20Mifflin%20Harcourt/9780544217737/1380351717.25.jpg", "publisher": {"uuid": "mgiqkRVmdsaEkGeGuyRSFX", "name": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"}, "awards": [{"uuid": "TAR7ToA2sHGZVqtkLY9wC6", "image": null, "name": "New York Times Bestseller"}], "language_code": "eng", "publication_date": "2013-10-15"}, "annotation": "", "position": 80},{"uuid": "3cAjpgWB4rza5kDEVfJESm", "book": {"uuid": "3GZPfafHULuiJBqVTTNdAP", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "author": "Dave Eggers", "status": 1, "average_rating": 4.0, "oyster_summary": "", "number_print_pages": 384, "description": "Dave Eggers and his students at the 826 Valencia and 826 Michigan writing labs&#160;compile fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and comics, as well as&#160;category-defying gems that have become one of the hallmarks of this lively collection.", "isbn": "9780544108868", "title": "The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2013", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Houghton%20Mifflin%20Harcourt/9780544108868/1379662252.27.jpg", "publisher": {"uuid": "mgiqkRVmdsaEkGeGuyRSFX", "name": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"}, "awards": [], "language_code": "eng", "publication_date": "2013-10-08"}, "annotation": "", "position": 81},{"uuid": "itieorZPagqNSu2kZ3WPU", "book": {"uuid": "8ymWFFkw6QQUiZeWZjxVZM", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "author": "Chuck Wendig", "status": 1, "average_rating": 0.0, "oyster_summary": "", "number_print_pages": 273, "description": "<p><p>Miriam is on the road again, having transitioned from \u201cthief\u201d\u2026 to \u201ckiller\u201d.</p>\n<p>Hired by a wealthy businessman, she heads down to Florida to practice the one thing she\u2019s good at, but in her vision she sees him die by another\u2019s hand and on the wall written in blood is a message just for Miriam.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s expected\u2026</p></p>", "isbn": "9780857663399", "title": "The Cormorant", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Osprey%20Publishing%20Ltd/9780857663399/1385165197.57.jpg", "publisher": {"uuid": "CKve5rvBeXmrtiv2onthRU", "name": "Osprey Publishing Ltd"}, "awards": [], "language_code": "eng", "publication_date": "2013-12-31"}, "annotation": "", "position": 82},{"uuid": "JSGLUnwQZ6XbkiiHp6VpgY", "book": {"uuid": "eYF8o5dHaztXzK7vHQV9pU", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "author": "Jason Wilson", "status": 1, "average_rating": 3.59, "oyster_summary": "", "number_print_pages": 256, "description": "Number-one <I>New York Times</I> best-selling author of <I>Eat, Pray, Love </I>and <I>Committed:&#160;A Love Story</I>, Elizabeth Gilbert transports readers to far-flung locales with this collection of the year&#8217;s lushest and most inspiring travel writing.", "isbn": "9780547810096", "title": "The Best American Travel Writing 2013", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Houghton%20Mifflin%20Harcourt/9780547810096/1379662251.15.jpg", "publisher": {"uuid": "mgiqkRVmdsaEkGeGuyRSFX", "name": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"}, "awards": [], "language_code": "eng", "publication_date": "2013-10-08"}, "annotation": "", "position": 83},{"uuid": "PieSNYdnCMmPEQa9vfixtd", "book": {"uuid": "DZ9Xx7QeyaK5nQnozcC5DP", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "author": "Carolyn Meyer", "status": 1, "average_rating": 3.23, "oyster_summary": "", "number_print_pages": 304, "description": "<P><B>What is it like to be the daughter of the most beautiful woman in the world?</B></B> <p>Hermione knows . . . her mother is Helen of Troy, the famed beauty of Greek myth.

But Welles was such a revolutionary filmmaker that he found himself at odds with the Hollywood studio system. His work was so far ahead of its time that he never regained the wide popular following he had once enjoyed as a young actor-director on the radio. What Ever Happened to Orson Welles?: A Portrait of an Independent Career challenges the conventional wisdom that Welles's career after Kane was a long decline and that he spent his final years doing little but eating and making commercials while squandering his earlier promise. In this intimate and often surprising personal portrait, Joseph McBride shows instead how Welles never stopped directing radical, adventurous films and was always breaking new artistic ground as a filmmaker. McBride is the first author to provide a comprehensive examination of the films of Welles's artistically rich yet little-known later period in the United States (1970--1985), when McBride knew and worked with him. McBride reports on Welles's daringly experimental film projects, including the legendary 1970--1976 unfinished film The Other Side of the Wind, Welles's satire of Hollywood during the \"Easy Rider era\"; McBride gives a unique insider perspective on Welles from the viewpoint of a young film critic playing a spoof of himself in a cast headed by John Huston and Peter Bogdanovich. To put Welles's widely misunderstood later years into context, What Ever Happened to Orson Welles? reexamines the filmmaker's entire life and career. McBride offers many fresh insights into the collapse of Welles's Hollywood career in the 1940s, his subsequent political blacklisting, and his long period of European exile. An enlightening and entertaining look at Welles's brilliant and enigmatic career as a filmmaker, What Ever Happened to Orson Welles? serves as a major reinterpretation of Welles's life and work. McBride clears away the myths that have long obscured Welles's later years and have caused him to be falsely regarded as a tragic failure. McBride's revealing portrait of this great artist will change the terms of how Orson Welles is understood as a man, an actor, a political figure, and a filmmaker.</P>", "isbn": "9780813145969", "title": "What Ever Happened to Orson Welles?", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/The%20University%20Press%20of%20Kentucky/9780813145969/1386303951.01.jpg", "publisher": {"uuid": "iuSURhCXJFGWkyZ8VQxgb", "name": "The University Press of Kentucky"}, "awards": [], "language_code": "eng", "publication_date": "2013-12-06"}, "annotation": "", "position": 97},{"uuid": "VHCJSf4iTThfVyUSXq3xmS", "book": {"uuid": "YGDUcX2mX9n2FfUU2BGy9W", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "author": "Gene D.

In Godfather, Phillips argues that Coppola has repeatedly bucked the Hollywood \"factory system\" in an attempt to create distinct films that reflect his own artistic vision -- often to the detriment of his career and finances. Phillips conducted interviews with the director and his colleagues and examined Coppola's production journals and screenplays. Phillips also reviewed rare copies of Coppola's student films, his early excursions into soft-core pornography, and his less celebrated productions such as One from the Heart and Tucker: The Man and His Dream.

Once our hominid ancestors began cooking their food, the human digestive tract shrank and the brain grew. Time once spent chewing tough raw food could be sued instead to hunt and to tend camp.

It is also the story of Dantine himself, who desperately seeks Disney's recognition at the risk of his own ruin.\r\n\r\nPeter Stephan Jungk has infused a new energy into the genre of fictionalized biography. Dantine, imbued with a sense of European superiority, first refuses to submit to Disney's rule, but is nevertheless fascinated by the childlike omnipotence of a man who identifies with Mickey Mouse. We discover Walt's delusions of immortality via cryogenic preservation, his tirades alongside his Abraham Lincoln talking robot, his invitation of Nikita Khruschev to Disneyland once he learns that the Soviet Premier wants to visit the park, his utopian visions of his EPCOT project, and his backyard labyrinth of toy trains. Yet, if at first Walt seems to have a magic wand granting him all his wishes, we soon discover that he is as tortured as the man who tells his story.\r\n\r\nAfter Disney refuses to acknowledge Dantine's self-professed talent and hard work, he fires the frustrated cartoonist for writing, along with other staff members, an anonymous polemical memorandum regarding Disney's jingoistic politics. Years later, in the late 60s, still deeply wounded by his dismissal, Dantine follows Disney's trail to capture what makes Walt tick. Dantine wants us to grasp what it is like to live and breathe around the man who thought of himself as more famous than Santa Claus. Walt's wife Lillian, his confidante and perhaps his mistress Hazel, his brother Roy, his children Diane and Sharon, his close and ill-treated collaborators, and famous figures such as Peter Ustinov, Salvador Dali, Andy Warhol, and Geraldine Chaplin, all contribute to the novel's animation, its feel for the life of the Disney world. \r\n\r\nThis deeply researched work not only provides interesting interpretations of what made Walt Disney a central figure in American popular culture, but also explores the complex expectations of gifted European immigrants who came to the United States after World War II with preconceived notions of how to achieve the American dream.", "isbn": "9781590515785", "title": "The Perfect American", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Other%20Press/9781590515785/1378049484.04.jpg", "publisher": {"uuid": "PptG96mv8h2SgUXH5Muqsm", "name": "Other Press"}, "awards": [], "language_code": "English", "publication_date": "2012-12-04"}, "annotation": "", "position": 154},{"uuid": "aA55Q4qjHJNdBNtNZzjzn3", "book": {"uuid": "uCpC8WMTXHqrzNmFHbpTgT", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "author": "George Prochnik", "status": 1, "average_rating": 0.0, "oyster_summary": "", "number_print_pages": 0, "description": "Winner of the 2007 Gradiva Award\r\n\r\nAn innovative work of biography that traces the lasting impact of the friendship between Sigmund Freud and pioneering American psychologist James Jackson Putnam. \r\n\r\nIn 1909 Sigmund Freud made his only visit to America, which included a trip to \"Putnam Camp\u201d\u2013the eminent American psychologist James Jackson Putnam's family retreat in the Adirondacks. \"Of all the things that I have experienced in America, this is by far the most amazing,\" Freud wrote of Putnam Camp. Putnam, a Boston Unitarian, and Freud, a Viennese Jew, came from opposite worlds, cherished polarized ambitions, and promoted seemingly irreconcilable visions of human nature\u2013and yet they struck up an unusually fruitful collaboration. Putnam's unimpeachable reputation played a crucial role in legitimizing the psychoanalytic movement. By the time of Putnam's death in 1918, psychoanalysis had been launched in America, where\u2013in large part thanks to the influence of Putnam, and in a development Freud had not anticipated\u2013it went on to become a practice that moved beyond the vicissitudes of desire to cultivate the growth and spiritual aspirations of the individual as a whole. \r\n\r\nPutnam Camp reveals details of Putnam's and Freud's personal lives that have never been fully explored before, including the crucial role Putnam's muse, Susan Blow\u2013founder of America's first kindergarten, pioneering educator and philosopher in the American Hegelian movement\u2013played in the intense debate between these two great thinkers. As the great-grandson of Putnam, author George Prochnik had access to a wealth of personal firsthand material from the Putnam family\u2013as well as from the James and Emerson families\u2013all of which contribute to a new and intimate vision of the texture of daily life at a moment when America was undergoing a cultural and intellectual renaissance.", "isbn": "9781590516218", "title": "Putnam Camp", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Other%20Press/9781590516218/1378049500.86.jpg", "publisher": {"uuid": "PptG96mv8h2SgUXH5Muqsm", "name": "Other Press"}, "awards": [], "language_code": "English", "publication_date": "2012-12-04"}, "annotation": "", "position": 155},{"uuid": "pWiiubnBVpyvhXAy5Y7SKU", "book": {"uuid": "EYmcMmipXaMyZevDay5BwJ", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "author": "Simon Mawer", "status": 1, "average_rating": 3.59, "oyster_summary": "", "number_print_pages": 336, "description": "Like his great-great-great-uncle, geneticist Gregor Mendel, Dr. Benedict Lambert struggles to unlock the secrets of heredity and genetic determinism.

An unforgiving place, home to the most elite warriors of the world, Thor's powers and abilities deepen as he trains. His friendships deepen, too, as they face adversities together, beyond what they could imagine. But as they find themselves up against unimaginable monsters , The Hundred quickly goes from training session to a matter of life or death. Not all will survive.\n\nAlong the way, Thor's dreams, along with his mysterious encounters with Argon, will continue to plague him, to press him to try to learn more about who he is, who his mother is, and what the source of his powers are. What is his destiny?\n\nBack in the Ring, matters are getting much worse. As Kendrick is imprisoned, Gwendolyn finds it landing on her to try to save him, to save the Ring by bringing down her brother Gareth. She hunts for clues for her father's murderer along with her brother Godfrey, and along the way, the two of them will become much closer, united in their cause. But Gwendolyn finds herself in mortal danger as she presses too deep, and she may be in over her head.\n\nGareth attempts to wield the Dynasty Sword and learns what it means to be King, becoming drunk with the abuse of power. He rules ruthlessly, becoming paranoid. As the noose tightens on the king's assassin, the McClouds attack deeper into the Ring, and King's Court finds itself in an increasingly precarious position.\n\nGwendolyn pines for Thor's return, for them to be together, for their love to blossom. But with powerful forces in their way, it is questionable if that chance will ever come.\n\nWill Thor survive The Hundred? Will King's Court collapse? Will MacGil's murderer be found? Will Gwendolyn end up with Thor? And will Thor finally learn the secret of his destiny?\n\nWith its sophisticated world-building and characterization, A FEAST OF DRAGONS is an epic tale of friends and lovers, of rivals and suitors, of knights and dragons, of intrigues and political machinations, of coming of age, of broken hearts, of deception, ambition and betrayal. It is a tale of honor and courage, of fate and destiny, of sorcery. It is a fantasy that brings us into a world we will never forget, and which will appeal to all ages and genders. It is nearly 70,000 words.\n\nNOTE: In response to reader requests, the book has now been professionally edited and copyedited, and this file version has all the typographical and grammatical errors corrected.\n\nBooks #4, #5 and #6 in the series, A CLASH OF HONOR, A VOW OF GLORY and A CHARGE OF VALOR are now also available!

Personalities such as Elvis Presley, Oprah Winfrey, and Michael Jordan are more recognizable to many people than are most elected officials. With Amusement for All is the first comprehensive history of two centuries of mass entertainment in the United States, covering everything from the penny press to Playboy, the NBA to NASCAR, big band to hip hop, and other topics including film, comics, television, sports, dance, and music. Paying careful attention to matters of race, gender, class, technology, economics, and politics, LeRoy Ashby emphasizes the complex ways in which popular culture simultaneously reflects and transforms American culture, revealing that the world of entertainment constantly evolves as it tries to meet the demands of a diverse audience. Trends in popular entertainment often reveal the tensions between competing ideologies, appetites, and values in American society. For example, in the late nineteenth century, Americans embraced \"self-made men\" such as John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie: the celebrities of the day were circus tycoons P.T. Barnum and James A. Bailey, Wild West star \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody, professional baseball organizer Albert Spalding, and prizefighter John L. Sullivan. At the same time, however, several female performers challenged traditional notions of weak, frail Victorian women. Adah Isaacs Menken astonished crowds by wearing tights that made her appear nude while performing dangerous stunts on horseback, and the shows of the voluptuous burlesque group British Blondes often centered on provocative images of female sexual power and dominance. Ashby describes how history and politics frequently influence mainstream entertainment. When Native Americans, blacks, and other non-whites appeared in the nineteenth-century circuses and Wild West shows, it was often to perpetuate demeaning racial stereotypes -- crowds jeered Sitting Bull at Cody's shows. By the early twentieth century, however, black minstrel acts reveled in racial tensions, reinforcing stereotypes while at the same time satirizing them and mocking racist attitudes before a predominantly white audience. Decades later, Red Foxx and Richard Pryor's profane comedy routines changed American entertainment. The raw ethnic material of Pryor's short-lived television show led to a series of African-American sitcoms in the 1980s that presented common American experiences -- from family life to college life -- with black casts. Mainstream entertainment has often co-opted and sanitized fringe amusements in an ongoing process of redefining the cultural center and its boundaries. Social control and respectability vied with the bold, erotic, sensational, and surprising, as entrepreneurs sought to manipulate the vagaries of the market, control shifting public appetites, and capitalize on campaigns to protect public morals. Rock 'n Roll was one such fringe culture; in the 1950s, Elvis blurred gender norms with his androgynous style and challenged conventions of public decency with his sexually-charged performances. By the end of the 1960s, Bob Dylan introduced the social consciousness of folk music into the rock scene, and The Beatles embraced hippie counter-culture. Don McLean's 1971 anthem \"American Pie\" served as an epitaph for rock's political core, which had been replaced by the spectacle of hard rock acts such as Kiss and Alice Cooper. While Rock 'n Roll did not lose its ability to shock, in less than three decades it became part of the established order that it had originally sought to challenge. With Amusement for All provides the context to what Americans have done for fun since 1830, showing the reciprocal nature of the relationships between social, political, economic, and cultural forces and the way in which the entertainment world has reflected, refracted, or reinforced the values those forces represent in America.</P>", "isbn": "9780813141329", "title": "With Amusement for All", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/The%20University%20Press%20of%20Kentucky/9780813141329/1377070950.91.jpg", "publisher": {"uuid": "iuSURhCXJFGWkyZ8VQxgb", "name": "The University Press of Kentucky"}, "awards": [], "language_code": "eng", "publication_date": "2006-04-12"}, "annotation": "", "position": 224},{"uuid": "GXokXymtKwkBwUs8xEym8d", "book": {"uuid": "BNtLFLgxEDm3zMhL7F2toh", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "author": "Sharin N.
