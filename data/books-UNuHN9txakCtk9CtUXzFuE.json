The account illustrates how the author attempted to convince the government to investigate allegations surrounding a multinational corporation, suspecting that they were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of South Africans who were mining vanadium&#151;a vital strategic mineral. Documenting Coleman-Adebayo&#8217;s shocking discovery that the EPA itself was the first line of defense for the corporation in question, this record depicts how the agency stonewalled, prompting the author to expose them. The agency&#8217;s brutal retaliation is captured in detail, revealing their use of every racist and sexist trick in their playbook, costing the protagonist her career, endangering her family, and sacrificing more lives in the vanadium mines of South Africa. Finishing on a hopeful note, the recollection concludes with the upwelling of support the author received from others in the federal bureaucracy, detailing how her subsequent grassroots struggle to protect future whistleblowers ended in victory.</P></DIV></DIV>", "oyster_good_for_statement": ""}, "position": 4, "uuid": "S6TEq26CwVHgng2sap6pLd", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"author": "Tom Devine", "publication_date": "2011-04-04", "oyster_summary": "", "status": 1, "language_code": "eng", "number_print_pages": 288, "title": "The Corporate Whistleblower's Survival Guide", "uuid": "ndARGR2UbZWAo3eKGTQfA5", "awards": [], "publisher": {"name": "Berrett-Koehler Publishers", "uuid": "mvChomkNc5FQWDmSbatSc9"}, "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Berrett-Koehler%20Publishers/9781605099880/1384815762.23.jpg", "average_rating": 0.0, "isbn": "9781605099880", "description": "From Erin Brockovich to Enron, whistleblowers who \u201cchallenge abuses of power that betray the public trust\u201d have proven to be an unfortunate necessity in modern business culture.

Exorbitant interest rates led borrowers into never-ending debt spirals, and aggressive collection practices resulted in cases of forced prostitution, child labor, suicide, and nationwide revolts against the microfinance community. \r\n\r\nSinclair weaves a shocking tale of a system increasingly focused on maximizing profits\u2014particularly once large banks got involved. He details his discovery of several scandals, one of the most disturbing involving a large African microfinance institution of questionable legality that charged interest rates in excess of 100 percent per year and whose investors and supporters included some of the most celebrated leaders of the microfinance sector.
