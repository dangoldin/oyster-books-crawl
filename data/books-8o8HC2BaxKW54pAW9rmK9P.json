In the prologue to the book, he tells what it's like to be constantly compared with William Faulkner, a writer with whom he shares inspiration from the Mississippi land. The essays that follow show that influence as undeniable. Here is the pond Larry reclaims and restocks on his place in Tula. Here is the Oxford bar crowd on a wild goose chase to a fabled fishing event. And here is the literary sensation trying to outsmart a wily coyote intent on killing the farm's baby goats. Woven in are intimate reflections on the Southern musicians and writers whose work has inspired Brown's and the thrill of his first literary recognition.<p>  But the centerpiece of this book is the title essay which embodies every element of Larry Brown's most emotional attachments-to the family, the land, the animals. This is a book for every Larry Brown fan. It is also an invaluable book for every reader interested in how a great writer responds, both personally and artistically, to the patch of land he lives on. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>", "isbn": "9781565127098", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Algonquin%20Books/9781565127098/1377656600.27.jpg", "oyster_summary": "", "average_rating": 3.89, "language_code": "eng", "awards": [], "title": "Billy Ray's Farm", "publication_date": "2001-04-01", "number_print_pages": 216}, "position": 1, "uuid": "4iYezwae773g3e4vji9TjQ", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"oyster_good_for_statement": "", "publisher": {"uuid": "ABL9TuZsJ5ThMeAYb933uA", "name": "Oyster"}, "status": 1, "author": "Karl Marx", "uuid": "ns5EiaaXWbX6jqm3Qe6Y7Q", "description": "This is a pre-1923 historical reproduction that was curated for quality.
