We have given ourselves over to self-serving belief and \"contrived nonsense\" or, more simply, fraud. This has come at the expense of the economy, effective government, and the business world.<BR>Particularly noted is the central power of the corporation and the shift in authority from shareholders and board members to management. In an intense exercise of fraud, the pretense of shareholder power is still maintained, even with the immediate participants. In fact, because of the scale and complexity of the modern corporation, decisive power must go to management. From management and its own inevitable self-interest, power extends deeply into government -- the so-called public sector. This is particularly and dangerously the case in such matters as military policy, the environment, and, needless to say, taxation. Nevertheless, there remains the firm reference to the public sector.<BR>How can fraud be innocent? In his inimitable style, Galbraith offers the answer. His taut, wry, and severe comment is essential reading for everyone who cares about America's future.

The book brings to life the people and ideas that forged modern finance and investing, from the formative days of Wall Street through the Great Depression and into the financial calamity of today. It's a tale that features professors who made and lost fortunes, battled fiercely over ideas, beat the house in blackjack, wrote bestselling books, and played major roles on the world stage. It's also a tale of Wall Street's evolution, the power of the market to generate wealth and wreak havoc, and free market capitalism's war with itself.</p><p>The efficient market hypothesis&#8212;long part of academic folklore but codified in the 1960s at the University of Chicago&#8212;has evolved into a powerful myth. It has been the maker and loser of fortunes, the driver of trillions of dollars, the inspiration for index funds and vast new derivatives markets, and the guidepost for thousands of careers. The theory holds that the market is always right, and that the decisions of millions of rational investors, all acting on information to outsmart one another, always provide the best judge of a stock's value. That myth is crumbling.</p><p>Celebrated journalist and columnist Fox introduces a new wave of economists and scholars who no longer teach that investors are rational or that the markets are always right. Many of them now agree with Yale professor Robert Shiller that the efficient markets theory &#8220;represents one of the most remarkable errors in the history of economic thought.&#8221; Today the theory has given way to counterintuitive hypotheses about human behavior, psychological models of decision making, and the irrationality of the markets. Investors overreact, underreact, and make irrational decisions based on imperfect data. In his landmark treatment of the history of the world's markets, Fox uncovers the new ideas that may come to drive the market in the century ahead. </p>", "isbn": "9780061885709", "language_code": "eng", "awards": []}, "uuid": "a34CQzyaq65gXVmiEj7uY3", "annotation": ""},{"position": 11, "book": {"publisher": {"name": "Atlantic Books", "uuid": "6iz42cktaNSt9xW8dH54gj"}, "author": "Vince Cable", "status": 1, "average_rating": 3.18, "title": "The Storm", "uuid": "AVAvyXcACMM6PYpy5qdj6o", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Atlantic%20Books/The%20Storm/1372980820.63.jpg", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "publication_date": "2010-02-01", "number_print_pages": 186, "oyster_summary": "", "description": "<DIV><DIV><B><DIV><B>An indispensable and&#160;absolutely accessible&#160;explanation of the&#160;causes of the world economic crisis and how we should respond to it</B></DIV><DIV>&#160;</DIV><DIV><B></B></DIV></B></B></DIV><DIV><DIV>In this urgent and timely book, the man&#160;the <I>Daily Telegraph</I>&#160;calls&#160;\"the sage&#160;of the credit crunch\"&#160;shows that although the downturn is global, the complacency of the British government towards the huge \"bubble\" in property prices and high levels of personal debt, combined with increasingly exotic trading within the financial markets, has left Britain badly exposed.

S. multinationals. Once these countries were saddled with huge debts, the American government and the international aid agencies allied with it were able, by dictating repayment terms, to essentially control their economies.

For over a decade Perkins traveled all over the world--Indonesia, Panama, Ecuador, Columbia, Saudi Arabia, Iran--and worked with men like Panamanian president Omar Torrijos, who became a personal friend. He helped implement a secret scheme that funneled billions of Saudi petrodollars back into the U. S. economy, and that further cemented the intimate relationship between the Islamic fundamentalist House of Saud and a succession of American administrations.

But today there are three Americas. At one extreme are the brain hubs&mdash;cities like San Francisco, Boston, and Durham&mdash;with workers who are among the most productive, creative, and best paid on the planet. At the other extreme are former manufacturing capitals, which are rapidly losing jobs and residents. The rest of America could go either way.

This transformation has been so spectacular that some have called it a miracle. How did it happen? Taking the reader from the docksides of Korea to the halls of India's finance ministry, <em>The Miracle</em> details the courageous decisions and heroic self-sacrifice that made Asia's ascent possible. Spanning nine countries and probing major historical currents, this account illuminates not only Asia's extraordinary economic rise but also how its causes might emancipate the developing world from poverty and guide the developed world to further prosperity. </p><p>Using more than a decade of reporting and analysis, <em>Time</em> magazine and former <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter Michael Schuman uncovers how outsourcing to Asia began; how Asia's most famous companies, such as Sony and Honda, became global corporations; and how technological changes and global economic shifts made Asia's boom possible. He reveals the compelling human side to this economic story, introducing readers to the political strongmen, entrepreneurs, and policymakers who made the Miracle a reality. This engaging historical narrative brings to life the ideas and actions of a diverse group of Asians&#8212;dictators and democrats, generals and technocrats, economists and engineers. </p><p>Some of the characters in the book have captured the global imagination for years, such as China's reformer Deng Xiaoping and Sony founder Akio Morita. Others are less well known, including Park Chung Hee, Korea's tightfisted nation builder; Liu Chuanzhi, the risk-taking founder of PC maker Lenovo; and Azim Premji, the mastermind behind Wipro, one of India's technology giants. All of them shared a dream&#8212;to elevate Asia to its proper place of influence in the world and eradicate the poverty around them. </p><p><em>The Miracle</em> not only offers profound insight into Asia and its increasing wealth and power; it also reveals how these seismic shifts continue to reverberate through the global economy. The implications of Asia's economic ascent for the rest of the world are surprising, promising, and inspiring. Readers of <em>The Miracle</em> will gain a deep understanding of Asia's place in the global economy&#8212;and of their own. </p>", "isbn": "9780061888083", "language_code": "eng", "awards": []}, "uuid": "CAzczmg9Z22ZmBAmEQk3c6", "annotation": ""},{"position": 8, "book": {"publisher": {"name": "HarperCollins", "uuid": "ef6mgBa3njWeiz46odozni"}, "author": "Jay W.

This is \u201cthe commons,\u201d a term that denotes everything we share. Some parts of the commons are gifts of nature: the air and oceans, the web of species, wilderness, and watersheds. Others are the product of human creativity and endeavor: sidewalks and public spaces, the Internet, our languages, cultures, and technologies. Jonathan Rowe illuminates the scale and value of the commons, its symbiotic relationship with the rest of our economy, its importance to our personal and planetary well-being, and how it is threatened by privatization and neglect. He unifies many seemingly disparate struggles\u2014against pollution, excessive development, corporate marketing to children, and more\u2014with the force of this powerful idea. And he calls for new institutions that create a durable balance between the commons and the profit-seeking side of our economy.\n\n\u201cThis elegant book is a wonderful introduction to the originality of thought, clarity of expression, and humanity of vision that made Jonathan Rowe so respected by those who knew him.
