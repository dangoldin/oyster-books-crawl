A reform-minded Cold War commander and a shrewd tactician during Operation Desert Storm, Franks took command of CENTCOM at the dawn of what he calls a \"crease in history\" -- becoming the senior American military officer in the most dangerous region on earth. </p><p> Now, drawing on his own recollections and military records declassified for this book, Franks offers the first true insider's account of the war on terrorism that has changed the world since September 11, 2001. He puts you in the Operations Center for the launch of Operation Enduring Freedom just weeks after 9/11, capturing its uncertain early days and the historic victory that followed. He traces his relationship with the demanding Donald Rumsfeld, as early tensions over the pace of the campaign gave way to a strong and friendly collaboration. </p><p> When President Bush focused world attention on the threat of Iraq, Franks seized the moment to implement a bold new vision of joint warfare in planning Operation Iraqi Freedom.

He speaks frankly of intelligence shortcomings that endangered our troops, and of the credible WMD threats -- including eleventh-hour warnings from Arab leaders -- that influenced every planning decision. He offers an unvarnished portrait of the \"disruptive and divisive\" Washington bureaucracy, and&#160;a candid assessment&#160;of the war's aftermath. Yet in the end, as <em>American Soldier</em> demonstrates, the battles in Afghanistan and Iraq remain heroic victories -- wars of liberation won by troops whose valor was \"unequalled,\" Franks writes, \"by anything in the annals of war.\" </p><p>Few individuals have the chance to contribute so much of themselves to the American story as General Tommy Franks.
