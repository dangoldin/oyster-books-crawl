In Washington, DC, Northup was drugged, kidnapped, and sold into slavery. He spent the next twelve years on plantations in Louisiana, enduring backbreaking labor, unimaginable violence, and inhumane treatment at the hands of cruel masters, until a kind stranger helped to win his release.

He also reveals the secrets of how they think and how they get to and exploit you and those you love. You\u2019ll gain incredible insight into these negative people, which he refers to as BAITERs (Backstabbers, Abusers, Imposters, Takers, Exploiters, Reckless), and you\u2019ll gain the tools to protect yourself from their assaults. Dr. Phil's new book gives you the \u201cEvil Eight\u201d identifiers so you can see them coming from a mile away, as well as their \u201cSecret Playbook,\u201d which contains the \u201cNefarious 15\u201d tactics they use to exploit you and take what is yours mentally, physically, socially and professionally. Life Code then focuses on you and your playbook, which contains the \u201cSweet 16\u201d tactics for winning in the real world.\r\n\r\nEdgy, controversial and sometimes irreverent, Dr. Phil again abandons convention to prepare you to claim what you deserve and claim it now. You take flying lessons to learn to fly, swimming lessons to learn to swim, and singing lessons to learn to sing. So, why not take winning lessons to learn to win?\r\n\r\nIf you read this book, you\u2019re going to have a huge leg up on the competition, regardless of whether you\u2019re competing for a job, a spouse, a social position, or friends. You are going to have a well-thought-out, passion-fueled strategy built on the skills and confidence that flow from rolling up your sleeves and learning what others simply do not know. By the time you finish this book, you\u2019ll have the power to define success in your life, the ability to spot potential obstacles to your success, and the tools you can immediately implement to get and protect exactly what you want in this life.

The book brings to life the people and ideas that forged modern finance and investing, from the formative days of Wall Street through the Great Depression and into the financial calamity of today. It's a tale that features professors who made and lost fortunes, battled fiercely over ideas, beat the house in blackjack, wrote bestselling books, and played major roles on the world stage. It's also a tale of Wall Street's evolution, the power of the market to generate wealth and wreak havoc, and free market capitalism's war with itself.</p><p>The efficient market hypothesis&#8212;long part of academic folklore but codified in the 1960s at the University of Chicago&#8212;has evolved into a powerful myth. It has been the maker and loser of fortunes, the driver of trillions of dollars, the inspiration for index funds and vast new derivatives markets, and the guidepost for thousands of careers. The theory holds that the market is always right, and that the decisions of millions of rational investors, all acting on information to outsmart one another, always provide the best judge of a stock's value. That myth is crumbling.</p><p>Celebrated journalist and columnist Fox introduces a new wave of economists and scholars who no longer teach that investors are rational or that the markets are always right. Many of them now agree with Yale professor Robert Shiller that the efficient markets theory &#8220;represents one of the most remarkable errors in the history of economic thought.&#8221; Today the theory has given way to counterintuitive hypotheses about human behavior, psychological models of decision making, and the irrationality of the markets. Investors overreact, underreact, and make irrational decisions based on imperfect data. In his landmark treatment of the history of the world's markets, Fox uncovers the new ideas that may come to drive the market in the century ahead. </p>", "average_rating": 3.76, "author": "Justin Fox", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/HarperCollins/9780061885709/1376528244.14.jpg"}},{"annotation": "", "uuid": "ZKqQhF4tXSnMqxD7gPXAGZ", "position": 30, "book": {"uuid": "2o6oLDmZkUHAjveoLbLB6o", "status": 1, "oyster_summary": "", "language_code": "eng", "number_print_pages": 0, "title": "A Dark Kiss of Rapture", "publication_date": "2011-10-06", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "isbn": "9780982857175", "publisher": {"uuid": "RGa8HjdMD32msFSzjkHtoM", "name": "Sylvia Day"}, "awards": [], "description": "<p>Of all the Fallen, Raze&apos;s hungers are some of the darkest and most insatiable.

In a groundbreaking theory of our origins, Wrangham shows that the shift from raw to cooked foods was the key factor in human evolution. When our ancestors adapted to using fire, humanity began. Once our hominid ancestors began cooking their food, the human digestive tract shrank and the brain grew. Time once spent chewing tough raw food could be sued instead to hunt and to tend camp. Cooking became the basis for pair bonding and marriage, created the household, and even led to a sexual division of labor. Tracing the contemporary implications of our ancestors&rsquo; diets, <i>Catching Fire</i> sheds new light on how we came to be the social, intelligent, and sexual species we are today.
