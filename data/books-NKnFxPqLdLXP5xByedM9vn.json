Putnam's unimpeachable reputation played a crucial role in legitimizing the psychoanalytic movement. By the time of Putnam's death in 1918, psychoanalysis had been launched in America, where\u2013in large part thanks to the influence of Putnam, and in a development Freud had not anticipated\u2013it went on to become a practice that moved beyond the vicissitudes of desire to cultivate the growth and spiritual aspirations of the individual as a whole. \r\n\r\nPutnam Camp reveals details of Putnam's and Freud's personal lives that have never been fully explored before, including the crucial role Putnam's muse, Susan Blow\u2013founder of America's first kindergarten, pioneering educator and philosopher in the American Hegelian movement\u2013played in the intense debate between these two great thinkers. As the great-grandson of Putnam, author George Prochnik had access to a wealth of personal firsthand material from the Putnam family\u2013as well as from the James and Emerson families\u2013all of which contribute to a new and intimate vision of the texture of daily life at a moment when America was undergoing a cultural and intellectual renaissance.", "average_rating": 0.0, "author": "George Prochnik", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Other%20Press/9781590516218/1378049500.86.jpg"}},{"annotation": "", "uuid": "zCUn3ZuBvL4YG6sHJFcU4Z", "position": 15, "book": {"uuid": "mMdGZFR8awq3s8NRetk9X9", "status": 1, "oyster_summary": "", "language_code": "eng", "number_print_pages": 320, "title": "Space Has No Frontier", "publication_date": "2014-01-01", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "isbn": "9781909657045", "publisher": {"uuid": "khv5dn65ogcsxn9tB66Dsd", "name": "Bene Factum Publishing"}, "awards": [], "description": "<DIV><P style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=MsoNormal><B>An exploration of Lovell's life and achievements in the scientific and political context of the time</B></P><P style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=MsoNormal>&#160;</P><P style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=MsoNormal>The extraordinary life of Bernard Lovell began before World War I&#160;and his story encompasses many of the great events of the&#160;last&#160;100 years: World War II, the invention of radio astronomy, the space race, the Moon landings, the exploration of the solar system, the Cold War, the Cuban missile crisis, and the defense of Britain against nuclear attack.
