There was no glow of city lights on the horizon, no ranger station at the edge of the next valley, no quaint general store, no paved road. There was nothing but space, unbounded and untamed. A brilliant moon lit the blackness crystal clear. Moonshadows of every blade of grass danced silently in the wildness. It was the emptiest, quietest place I had ever been. I threw my arms out wide and spun slowly around and around in the dazzling clarity of the night, the stars blurring into ribbons of light above me.\"</blockquote> <br />\nMongolia. It was Erika Warmbrunn's dream. To escape deep into parts of Asia inaccessible to tours and guidebooks, to abandon herself to the risks of the unknown. And so, with only a bicycle named Greene for a traveling companion, she set off on an eight month, 8,000 kilometer trek that stretched across the steppes of this ancient land, on through China, and down the length of Vietnam. Freed by Greene's two wheels from the tyranny of discrete points on a map, she found that the true merit of travel was not in the simple seeing, but in flowing with the unexpected adventure or invitation, in savoring the moments in between -- the daily challenges of new words and customs, the tiny triumphs of learning a new way of life, the daunting thrill of never knowing what the next day would bring.<br />\n<br />\nWanting to ride a Mongolian horse and finding herself in the saddle for four hours, herding fifty head of cattle. Asking for a hotel in a Chinese village and being taken into a family's home to share their grandmother's bed for the night. Pedaling into the Vietnamese highlands and being stopped along the muddy road by a father asking that she join his two-year-old son's birthday party. Accepting a Mongolian village's invitation to stop pedaling and stay for a while, to live with them and teach them English.

It&rsquo;s one of those oh-please-don&rsquo;t-let-it-end books.  I&rsquo;d carry it in my backpack anywhere.&rdquo;&mdash;<strong>Cheryl Strayed, author of <em>Wild</em></strong></blockquote>\n  <p><br>\n  With comfortable urban lives in Houston, Texas, and career and life goals mostly accomplished, Gail D. Storey and her husband were in their fifties when they decided it was time to test themselves on a new path&mdash;a 2,663-mile path known as the Pacific Crest Trail, which stretches from Mexico to Canada. <br>\n  <br>\n  <em>I Promise Not to Suffer</em> is Gail's light-hearted yet heart-felt memoir about her and her husband's adventures and misadventures, deepening marriage, and reflections on being irrevocably changed by life on the trail. She was a novice hiker, while he was an experienced outdoorsman. Removed from their usual routines and living outside in the wilderness for months exposed hidden intricacies in their relationship. Hiking 20 miles a day over mountains, thirsting in the high desert of California, forcing frozen feet into icy socks and boots each morning in the High Sierra, stumbling through lava fields in Oregon&mdash;Gail was required to meet the elements on their own tough-love terms. From an encounter with a mountain lion to her mother's battle with cancer at home, she confronts each challenge with wit and brave style. While a dangerous loss of weight forces Gail to leave the PCT after 900 miles, she regains strength and later rejoins her husband on sections until he triumphantly reaches the northern terminus in Canada. <br>\n  <br>\n  Humorous yet honest, this journey of harrowing hilarity and reluctant revelations will be loved by active hikers (appendices include details of their unique ultralight gear and other essential how-to information), fans of female adventure stories, and armchair travelers alike.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em><strong>Praise for I Promise Not To Suffer:</strong><br>\n  <br>\n  </em>&ldquo;At times wrenching memoir, at times hilarious, <em>I Promise Not to Suffer</em> pulls no punches and has a wicked sense of fun. Storey reminds me again of what  is possible with a big imagination, a dose of scrappy courage, and a lot of  love.&rdquo;<br>\n  --Peter Heller, author of <em>The Dog Stars</em> and <em>Kook<br>\n  &nbsp;<br>\n  </em>&ldquo;Some have called Gail Storey the Nora Ephron of the wilderness. With her  own unique wit, Storey shares Ephron&rsquo;s commitment to creating and tending a  long, nourishing marriage. <em>I Promise Not to Suffer</em> is a portrait of a  union that does not fray or break under pressure but is forged, toughened, and  tenderized.&rdquo;<br>\n  --Sara Davidson, author of<em> Leap!, Loose Change,</em> and <em>The December  Project<br>\n  </em><br>\n  &ldquo;Of the many books that I have read about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, none  have captured the trail experience from so many different perspectives.Single  hikers, couples, and those who stay behind will all enjoy Gail Storey&rsquo;s account  of the challenges, the beauty, and the PCT community found along the way.&rdquo;<br>\n  --Liz Bergeron, Executive Director and CEO, Pacific Crest Trail Association </p>", "isbn": "9781594857461", "language_code": "eng", "awards": [], "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "oyster_summary": "", "publication_date": "2013-03-15", "number_print_pages": 226, "average_rating": 4.5, "title": "I Promise Not To Suffer", "uuid": "okmFmk9MYvYR6RLmCGjwPa", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/The%20Mountaineers%20Books/9781594857461/1377654710.68.jpg", "publisher": {"name": "The Mountaineers Books", "uuid": "CuGzkxfXsKr327nnE5cKN3"}, "author": "Gail D.
