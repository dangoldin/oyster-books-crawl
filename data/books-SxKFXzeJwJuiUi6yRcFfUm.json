Eclipsed by a new breed of developers, financiers, and manufacturers, this pampered scion begins his gradual descent from the midwestern aristocracy to the working class. Today The Magnificent Ambersons is best known through the 1942 Orson Welles movie, but as the critic Stanley Kauffmann noted, \"It is high time that [the novel] appear again, to stand outside the force of Welles's genius, confident in its own right.\" \"The Magnificent Ambersons is perhaps Tarkington's best novel,\" judged Van Wyck Brooks. \"[It is] a typical story of an American family and town--the great family that locally ruled the roost and vanished virtually in a day as the town spread and darkened into a city.

But it's not the secret of his affair, at seventy-one, with Faunia Farley, a woman half his age with a savagely wrecked past - a part-time farmhand and a janitor at the college where, until recently, he was the powerful dean of faculty.

With its profound sense of moral isolation and its compassionate glimpses into its characters' inner lives, the novel is considered McCullers' finest work, an enduring masterpiece first published by Houghton Mifflin in 1940. At its center is the deaf-mute John Singer, who becomes the confidant for various types of misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for escape from small town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane, Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's heroine (and loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her music. Wonderfully attuned to the spiritual isolation that underlies the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated -- and, through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal search for beauty.<br>     Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her ability \"to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness.\" She writes \"with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming,\" said the NEW YORK TIMES.

Bix offers the first complete, unvarnished look at the enigmatic leader whose sixty-three-year reign ushered Japan into the modern world. Never before has the full life of this controversial figure been revealed with such clarity and vividness. Bix shows what it was like to be trained from birth for a lone position at the apex of the nation's political hierarchy and as a revered symbol of divine status. Influenced by an unusual combination of the Japanese imperial tradition and a modern scientific worldview, the young emperor gradually evolves into his preeminent role, aligning himself with the growing ultranationalist movement, perpetuating a cult of religious emperor worship, resisting attempts to curb his power, and all the while burnishing his image as a reluctant, passive monarch. Here we see Hirohito as he truly was: a man of strong will and real authority.</p><p>Supported by a vast array of previously untapped primary documents, <em>Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan </em>is perhaps most illuminating in lifting the veil on the mythology surrounding the emperor's impact on the world stage. Focusing closely on Hirohito's interactions with his advisers and successive Japanese governments, Bix sheds new light on the causes of the China War in 1937 and the start of the Asia-Pacific War in 1941. And while conventional wisdom has had it that the nation's increasing foreign aggression was driven and maintained not by the emperor but by an elite group of Japanese militarists, the reality, as witnessed here, is quite different. Bix documents in detail the strong, decisive role Hirohito played in wartime operations, from the takeover of Manchuria in 1931 through the attack on Pearl Harbor and ultimately the fateful decision in 1945 to accede to an unconditional surrender. In fact, the emperor stubbornly prolonged the war effort and then used the horrifying bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together with the Soviet entrance into the war, as his exit strategy from a no-win situation. From the moment of capitulation, we see how American and Japanese leaders moved to justify the retention of Hirohito as emperor by whitewashing his wartime role and reshaping the historical consciousness of the Japanese people. The key to this strategy was Hirohito's alliance with General MacArthur, who helped him maintain his stature and shed his militaristic image, while MacArthur used the emperor as a figurehead to assist him in converting Japan into a peaceful nation. Their partnership ensured that the emperor's image would loom large over the postwar years and later decades, as Japan began to make its way in the modern age and struggled -- as it still does -- to come to terms with its past.</p><p>Until the very end of a career that embodied the conflicting aims of Japan's development as a nation, Hirohito remained preoccupied with politics and with his place in history. <em>Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan</em> provides the definitive account of his rich life and legacy. Meticulously researched and utterly engaging, this book is proof that the history of twentieth-century Japan cannot be understood apart from the life of its most remarkable and enduring leader.</p>", "isbn": "9780061860478", "language_code": "eng", "awards": [{"name": "National Book Critics Circle Award Winner", "image": null, "uuid": "8YMQPG32TB3yRipbSoRKZB"}, {"name": "Winner of the Pulitzer Prize", "image": null, "uuid": "F4B9gynsFCkRN5YRrFwRBM"}]}, "uuid": "DsL7xaovCR2wfYnUQbMaD7", "annotation": ""},{"position": 13, "book": {"publisher": {"name": "Open Road Media", "uuid": "M3vVhZgj8kLjFHReaifoaJ"}, "author": "Shirley Ann Grau", "status": 1, "average_rating": 3.85, "title": "The Keepers of the House", "uuid": "NTB4BbVNsRceKiw7AbebTM", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Open%20Road%20Media/The%20Keepers%20of%20the%20House/1373330520.32.jpg", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "publication_date": "2012-04-10", "number_print_pages": 312, "oyster_summary": "", "description": "<DIV><DIV><b>Grau&rsquo;s Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winning classic, about the racial prejudice and long-buried secrets that threaten to destroy a distinguished Southern family </b></div><DIV><b>&#160;</b></div><DIV>The Howland dynasty began after the War of 1812, when a young Tennessee solider fighting for Andrew Jackson settled in Alabama.

On the heels of their arranged wedding, Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli settle together in Cambridge, Massachusetts. An engineer by training, Ashoke adapts far less warily than his wife, who resists all things American and pines for her family. When their son is born, the task of naming him betrays the vexed results of bringing old ways to the new world. Named for a Russian writer by his Indian parents in memory of a catastrophe years before, Gogol Ganguli knows only that he suffers the burden of his heritage as well as his odd, antic name. Lahiri brings great empathy to Gogol as he stumbles along the first-generation path, strewn with conflicting loyalties, comic detours, and wrenching love affairs. With penetrating insight, she reveals not only the defining power of the names and expectations bestowed upon us by our parents, but also the means by which we slowly, sometimes painfully, come to define ourselves. <I>The New York Times</I> has praised Lahiri as \"a writer of uncommon elegance and poise.\"<I> The Namesake</I> is a fine-tuned, intimate, and deeply felt novel of identity.</div>", "isbn": "9780547429311", "language_code": "eng", "awards": [{"name": "New York Times Bestseller", "image": null, "uuid": "TAR7ToA2sHGZVqtkLY9wC6"}]}, "uuid": "Jzdt59UrPFiE7cxwAQpBFP", "annotation": ""},{"position": 1, "book": {"publisher": {"name": "Open Road Media", "uuid": "M3vVhZgj8kLjFHReaifoaJ"}, "author": "Pearl S.

But everything he loves is lost when the country begins to run amok in the turbulent 1960s. Not even the most private, well-intentioned citizen, it seems, gets to sidestep the sweep of history. With vigorous realism, Roth takes us back to the conflicts and violent transitions of the 1960s. This is a book about loving - and hating - America. It's a book about wanting to belong - and refusing to belong - to America. It sets the desire for an American pastoral - a respectable life of space, calm, order, optimism, and achievement - against the indigenous American Berserk.</DIV>", "isbn": "9780547415970", "language_code": "eng", "awards": [{"name": "Prix du Meilleur Livre \u00c9tranger", "image": null, "uuid": "WxYJ6KnYGQru9m6rwmDLg"}, {"name": "Winner of the Pulitzer Prize", "image": null, "uuid": "F4B9gynsFCkRN5YRrFwRBM"}]}, "uuid": "E9wV2aYByViUJfNkBT86dT", "annotation": ""},{"position": 30, "book": {"publisher": {"name": "Basic Books", "uuid": "ZTLSUALTGiEwRDsTDLtu5B"}, "author": "Edward J.
