He describes the ongoing management of individual attentiveness and the impairment of perception within the compulsory routines of contemporary technological culture.

As World War II approaches, then falls upon them, they hurtle toward a catastrophic reckoning. Isaac must make decisions that, at first, only seem to be life-or-death, then actually are.<BR><BR>Meanwhile, South Africa&#8217;s history, bound up with Europe&#8217;s but inflected with its own accents&#8212;Afrikaans, Zulu, Yiddish, English&#8212;begins to unravel. Isaac&#8217;s vibrant, working-class, Jewish neighborhood lies near the African slums; under cover of night, the slums are razed, the residents forced off to townships. Isaac&#8217;s fortune-seeking takes him to the privileged seclusion of the Johannesburg suburbs, where he will court forbidden love. It partners him with the unlucky, unsinkable Hugo Bleznick, selling miracle products to suspicious farmers. And it leads him into a feud with a grayshirt Afrikaaner who insidiously undermines him in the auto shop, where Isaac has found the only work that ever felt true. And then his mother&#8217;s secret, long carefully guarded, takes them to the diamond mines, where everything is covered in a thin, metallic dust, where lions wait among desert rocks, and where Isaac will begin to learn the bittersweet reality of success bought at truly any cost.<BR><BR>A thrilling ride through the life of one fumbling young hero, <I>The Lion Seeker</I> is a glorious reinvention of the classic family and coming-of-age sagas.

Wonderfully attuned to the spiritual isolation that underlies the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated -- and, through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal search for beauty.<br>     Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her ability \"to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness.\" She writes \"with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming,\" said the NEW YORK TIMES.

It is a bitter, profoundly disenchanted story that satirizes  the military, authoritarianism, gender relationships, parenthood and  most of the assumed mid-century myths of the family. Haley Brandon, the  adolescent protagonist, comes to the farm of his relative, the old crazy  who insists upon being called The General, to learn to be a  straight-shooting American. Haley&rsquo;s only means of survival will lead him  to unflagging defiance of the General&rsquo;s deranged (but oh so American,  oh so military) values. This story and its thirtyish author were no  friends of the milieu to which the slick magazines&rsquo; advertisers were  pitching their products.<BR><br> When Vonnegut passed away in 2007, he left his last novel unfinished. Entitled <I>If God Were Alive Today</I>,  this last work is a brutal satire on societal ignorance and carefree  denial of the world&rsquo;s major problems. Protagonist Gil Berman is a  middle-aged college lecturer and self-declared stand-up comedian who  enjoys cracking jokes in front of a college audience while societal  dependence on fossil fuels has led to the apocalypse.

We learn, for example, how Proust first revealed the fallibility of memory; how George Eliot discovered the brain&#8217;s malleability; how the French chef Escoffier discovered umami (the fifth taste); how C&#233;zanne worked out the subtleties of vision; and how Gertrude Stein exposed the deep structure of language &#8212; a full half-century before the work of Noam Chomsky and other linguists.
