And before Bridget Jones was The Artificial Silk Girl. \r\n\r\nIn 1931, a young woman writer living in Germany was inspired by Anita Loos's Gentlemen Prefer Blondes to describe pre-war Berlin and the age of cinematic glamour through the eyes of a woman. The resulting novel, The Artificial Silk Girl, became an acclaimed bestseller and a masterwork of German literature, in the tradition of Christopher Isherwood's Berlin Stories and Bertolt Brecht's Three Penny Opera. Like Isherwood and Brecht, Keun revealed the dark underside of Berlin's \"golden twenties\" with empathy and honesty. Unfortunately, a Nazi censorship board banned Keun's work in 1933 and destroyed all existing copies of The Artificial Silk Girl. Only one English translation was published, in Great Britain, before the book disappeared in the chaos of the ensuing war. Today, more than seven decades later, the story of this quintessential \"material girl\" remains as relevant as ever, as an accessible new translation brings this lost classic to light once more.

The charge is a lie, but the real truth about Silk would have astonished his most virulent accuser. Coleman Silk has a secret. But it's not the secret of his affair, at seventy-one, with Faunia Farley, a woman half his age with a savagely wrecked past - a part-time farmhand and a janitor at the college where, until recently, he was the powerful dean of faculty. And it's not the secret of Coleman's alleged racism, which provoked the college witch-hunt that cost him his job and, to his mind, killed his wife. Nor is it the secret of misogyny, despite the best efforts of his ambitious young colleague, Professor Delphine Roux, to expose him as a fiend. Coleman's secret has been kept for fifty years: from his wife, his four children, his colleagues, and his friends, including the writer Nathan Zuckerman, who sets out to understand how this eminent, upright man, esteemed as an educator for nearly all his life, had fabricated his identity and how that cannily controlled life came unraveled. Set in 1990s America, where conflicting moralities and ideological divisions are made manifest through public denunciation and rituals of purification, The Human Stain concludes Philip Roth's eloquent trilogy of postwar American lives that are as tragically determined by the nation's fate as by the \"human stain\" that so ineradicably marks human nature.

The\r\ntwo lovers manage to keep their mutual attraction concealed, but\r\nas the hot months comes to an end, their meetings become more\r\ndifficult to conceal.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stella begins at the end, at Stella Petersen\u2019s memorial service,\r\nwhere Christian relives the memories he shared with his first love.\r\nThere is nothing salacious about their relationship, nor is it just a case\r\nof a teenager\u2019s crush on his teacher. Their affair changes both\r\nChristian and Stella, allows them to expand their views, and pushes\r\nthem out of social and familial constraints. Theirs is a tender love\r\nstory of a time, and yet speaks to any time; it is actually through\r\ndeath that their love is transformed.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sparseness of Siegfried Lenz\u2019s narrative is reminiscent of the\r\nexistential stringency of Ernest Hemingway.

With its profound sense of moral isolation and its compassionate glimpses into its characters' inner lives, the novel is considered McCullers' finest work, an enduring masterpiece first published by Houghton Mifflin in 1940. At its center is the deaf-mute John Singer, who becomes the confidant for various types of misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for escape from small town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane, Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's heroine (and loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her music. Wonderfully attuned to the spiritual isolation that underlies the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated -- and, through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal search for beauty.<br>     Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her ability \"to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness.\" She writes \"with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming,\" said the NEW YORK TIMES.

The Seagull was written in 1895 and first produced in 1896. It dramatizes the romantic and artistic conflicts between four characters: the famous middlebrow story writer Boris Trigorin, the ingenue Nina, the fading actress Irina Arkadina, and her son the symbolist playwright Konstantin Tr\u00e9plev.\r\n\r\nThe character of Trigorin is considered Chekhov's greatest male role, though as with the rest of Chekhov's full-length plays, The Seagull relies upon an ensemble cast of diverse, fully developed characters. In contrast to the melodrama of the mainstream theatre of the 19th century, lurid actions (such as Konstantin's suicide attempts) are not shown onstage. Characters tend to speak in ways that skirt around issues rather than addressing them directly; in other words, their lines are full of what is known in dramatic practice as subtext, or text that is not spoken aloud.\r\n\r\nThe opening night of the first production was a famous failure. Vera Komissarzhevskaya, playing Nina, was so intimidated by the hostility of the audience that she lost her voice. Chekhov left the audience and spent the last two acts behind the scenes. When supporters wrote to him that the production later became a success, he assumed that they were merely trying to be kind. When Constantin Stanislavski, the seminal Russian theatre practitioner of the time, directed it in 1898 for his Moscow Art Theatre, the play was a triumph. Stanislavski's production of The Seagull became \"one of the greatest events in the history of Russian theatre and one of the greatest new developments in the history of world drama.\"", "isbn": "9781629453767", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Oyster/9781629453767/1377121466.06.png", "oyster_summary": "", "average_rating": 3.9, "language_code": "", "awards": [], "title": "The Sea-Gull", "publication_date": null, "number_print_pages": 64}, "position": 20, "uuid": "ACuaFnM4i67K8d4gHMWEy8", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"oyster_good_for_statement": "", "publisher": {"uuid": "MhtC8FNyEPENXmjxyXMZLL", "name": "Melville House"}, "status": 1, "author": "Tao Lin", "uuid": "muaeu9bpwHCgxCua8pUt4j", "description": "<p>Set mostly in Manhattan\u2014although also featuring Atlantic City, Brooklyn, GMail Chat, and Gainsville, Florida\u2014this autobiographical novella, spanning two years in the life of a young writer with a cultish following, has been described by the author as \"A shoplifting book about vague relationships,\u201d \"2 parts shoplifting arrest, 5 parts vague relationship issues,\u201d and \"An ultimately life-affirming book about how the unidirectional nature of time renders everything beautiful and sad.\u201d</p>\n<p>From VIP rooms in \"hip\u201d New York City clubs to central booking in Chinatown, from New York University's Bobst Library to a bus in someone's backyard in a college-town in Florida, from Bret Easton Ellis to Lorrie Moore, and from Moby to Ghost Mice, it explores class, culture, and the arts in all their American forms through the funny, journalistic, and existentially-minded narrative of someone trying to both \"not be a bad person\u201d and \"find some kind of happiness or something,\u201d while he is driven by his failures and successes at managing his art, morals, finances, relationships, loneliness, confusion, boredom, future, and depression.</p>", "isbn": "9781612190280", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Melville%20House/9781612190280/1377114903.72.jpg", "oyster_summary": "", "average_rating": 3.1, "language_code": "English", "awards": [], "title": "Shoplifting from American Apparel.", "publication_date": "2010-12-29", "number_print_pages": 112}, "position": 10, "uuid": "kf2xqCi4FcEffNLHpoYBL8", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"oyster_good_for_statement": "", "publisher": {"uuid": "M3vVhZgj8kLjFHReaifoaJ", "name": "Open Road Media"}, "status": 1, "author": "Erskine Caldwell", "uuid": "YEcCcwrovpVFCawu8sM5Q9", "description": "<DIV><DIV><b>Caldwell&rsquo;s bestselling, controversial classic: the story of a Southern sharecropper family ground down by the devastation of the Great Depression</b></div><DIV>&#160;</div><DIV>Even before the Great Depression struck, Jeeter Lester and his family were desperately poor sharecroppers.

Dravot and Carnehan succeeded in becoming kings: finding the Kafirs, who turn out to be white, mustering an army, taking over villages, and dreaming of building a unified nation. The Kafirs, who were pagans, not Muslims, acclaimed Dravot as a god (the reincarnation or descendant of Alexander the Great) because an arrow appeared to be unable to penetrate his chest in a battle, and because he wore a Masonic symbol associated with Alexander. The Kafirs practiced a form of Masonic ritual and the adventurers knew Masonic secrets that only the oldest priest remembered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir schemes were dashed when Dravot decided to marry a Kafir girl. Terrified at marrying a god, the girl bit Dravot when he tried to kiss her. Seeing him bleed, the priests cried that he was \"Neither God nor Devil but a man!\" Most of the Kafirs turned against Dravot and Carnehan. One chief and a few of his men remained loyal, but the army defected and the two kings were captured.\r\n\r\n\r\nDravot, wearing his crown, stood on a rope bridge over a gorge while the Kafirs cut the ropes, and he fell to his death. Carnehan was crucified between two pine trees. When he survived for a day, the Kafirs considered it a miracle and let him go. He begged his way back to India.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs proof of his tale, Carnehan shows the narrator Dravot's head, still wearing the golden crown. Carnehan leaves.
