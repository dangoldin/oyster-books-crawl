Churchill", "awards": [], "description": "<p>Winston Churchill\u2019s monumental The Second World War, is a six volume account of the struggle between the Allied Powers in Europe against Germany and the Axis. Told by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, this book is also the story of one nation\u2019s heroic role in the fight against tyranny. Having learned a lesson at Munich they would never forget, the British refused to make peace with Hitler, defying him even after France had fallen and it seemed as though the Nazis were unstoppable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What lends this work its tension is Churchill\u2019s inclusion of primary source material. We hear Churchill\u2019s retrospective analysis of the war, but we are also presented with memos, letters, orders, speeches, and telegrams that give day-by-day accounts of the reactions as the drama unfolds. We listen as strategies and counter-strategies unfold in response to Hitler\u2019s conquest of Europe, his planned invasion of England, and his assault on Russia. All contrive to give a mesmerizing account of the crucial decisions that must be made as the fate of the world hangs in the balance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While in some ways a continuation of Churchill\u2019s history of World War I, <i>The World Crisis</i>, <i>The Gathering Storm</i> is his attempt to understand the terrible circumstance that gave rise to Nazi Germany and a second, even more destructive world conflict. Churchill was perhaps the only person who held such prominent positions of power in both world wars and as such, was uniquely qualified to tell the story from war to peace and back again.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>The Gathering Storm</i> covers the Treaty of Versailles, the rise of Adolf Hitler, the capitulation of Munich and the entry of Britain into the war. This book makes clear Churchill\u2019s feeling that the Second World War was a largely senseless but unavoidable conflict. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Churchill won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953 in part because of this awe-inspiring work.</p>", "isbn": "9780795308321", "title": "The Gathering Storm", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "status": 1, "publisher": {"uuid": "dTqzBTy8orKoBHPGFvBWUk", "name": "RosettaBooks"}}, "annotation": "", "uuid": "TzDMDYNREg5dQH6izQVx5B", "position": 27},{"book": {"oyster_summary": "", "number_print_pages": 496, "language_code": "eng", "publication_date": "2005-05-02", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Houghton%20Mifflin%20Harcourt/9780156035002/1376379622.5.jpg", "uuid": "wSH6ABfVfCGweajQKoU32K", "average_rating": 4.1, "author": "Jenna Blum", "awards": [], "description": "<DIV>For fifty years, Anna Schlemmer has refused to talk about her life in Germany during World War II.

Frequently, their male bosses were coarse and unsympathetic. Yet this hidden army of nearly two million women toiled on regardless through the worst years of the war, cheerfully ignoring the dangers and the exhaustion, as bombing, rationing, and the heartbreak of loss or separation took their toll on everyone in the country. Only now, all these years later, have they chosen to tell their remarkable stories. Here, in their own words, are the vivid wartime memories of the \"secret army\" of female munitions workers, whose resilience and sheer grit in the face of danger has only now started to emerge.These are the intimate and personal stories of an unforgettable group of women, whose hard work and quiet courage made a significant contribution to Britain's war effort. They didn't fire the bullets, but they filled them up with explosives. And in doing so, they helped Britain with the war.", "isbn": "9781782197164", "title": "Bomb Girls", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "status": 1, "publisher": {"uuid": "aBc7kBYnjQMD38TkrSLatj", "name": "John Blake"}}, "annotation": "", "uuid": "UiBRyA8e57ABre7tPUSCFg", "position": 37},{"book": {"oyster_summary": "", "number_print_pages": 400, "language_code": "eng", "publication_date": "2010-11-18", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/F%2BW%20Media/A%20Child%20al%20Confino/1373353311.34.jpg", "uuid": "KFCmsV87mkrxURNzXWCmZZ", "average_rating": 3.8, "author": "Eric Lamet", "awards": [], "description": "<p>Eric Lamet was only seven years old when the Nazis invaded Vienna - and changed his life and the lives of all European Jews forever. Five days after Hitler marches, Eric Lamet and his parents flee for their lives. His father goes back to his native Poland - and never returns. His mother hides out in Italy, on the run from place to place, taking her son deeper and deeper into the mountains to avoid capture.</p><p>In this remarkable feat of memory and imagination, Lamet recreates the Italy he knew from the perspective of the scared and lonely child he once was. We not only see the hardships and terrors faced by foreign Jews in Fascist Italy, but also the friends Eric makes and his mother's valiant efforts to make a home for him.</p><p>In a style as original as his story, the author vividly recalls a dark time yet imbues his recollections with humor, humanity, and wit. Very few Holocaust memoirs address the plight of Jews sent into internal exile in Mussolini's Italy. Lamet offers a rare and historically important portrait, one you will not soon forget.</p>", "isbn": "9781440511264", "title": "A Child al Confino", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "status": 1, "publisher": {"uuid": "JsHsEJtkRuFHr45a9ZkUyL", "name": "F+W Media"}}, "annotation": "", "uuid": "mbMZLV2zRcNQVbJJXqKrn", "position": 34}]
