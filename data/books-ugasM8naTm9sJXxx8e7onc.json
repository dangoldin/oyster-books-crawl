From a bizarre encounter with a Xena-obsessed hotel clerk in northern Thailand, to a stoned flight on a crumbling Russian plane in Laos, harassed in Vietnam and confused in Cambodia, Tamara Sheward takes a wayward journey through the underbelly of Southeast Asia so often bypassed by traditional travel writers.
