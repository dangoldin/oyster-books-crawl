Personalities such as Elvis Presley, Oprah Winfrey, and Michael Jordan are more recognizable to many people than are most elected officials. With Amusement for All is the first comprehensive history of two centuries of mass entertainment in the United States, covering everything from the penny press to Playboy, the NBA to NASCAR, big band to hip hop, and other topics including film, comics, television, sports, dance, and music. Paying careful attention to matters of race, gender, class, technology, economics, and politics, LeRoy Ashby emphasizes the complex ways in which popular culture simultaneously reflects and transforms American culture, revealing that the world of entertainment constantly evolves as it tries to meet the demands of a diverse audience. Trends in popular entertainment often reveal the tensions between competing ideologies, appetites, and values in American society. For example, in the late nineteenth century, Americans embraced \"self-made men\" such as John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie: the celebrities of the day were circus tycoons P.T. Barnum and James A. Bailey, Wild West star \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody, professional baseball organizer Albert Spalding, and prizefighter John L. Sullivan. At the same time, however, several female performers challenged traditional notions of weak, frail Victorian women. Adah Isaacs Menken astonished crowds by wearing tights that made her appear nude while performing dangerous stunts on horseback, and the shows of the voluptuous burlesque group British Blondes often centered on provocative images of female sexual power and dominance. Ashby describes how history and politics frequently influence mainstream entertainment. When Native Americans, blacks, and other non-whites appeared in the nineteenth-century circuses and Wild West shows, it was often to perpetuate demeaning racial stereotypes -- crowds jeered Sitting Bull at Cody's shows. By the early twentieth century, however, black minstrel acts reveled in racial tensions, reinforcing stereotypes while at the same time satirizing them and mocking racist attitudes before a predominantly white audience. Decades later, Red Foxx and Richard Pryor's profane comedy routines changed American entertainment. The raw ethnic material of Pryor's short-lived television show led to a series of African-American sitcoms in the 1980s that presented common American experiences -- from family life to college life -- with black casts. Mainstream entertainment has often co-opted and sanitized fringe amusements in an ongoing process of redefining the cultural center and its boundaries. Social control and respectability vied with the bold, erotic, sensational, and surprising, as entrepreneurs sought to manipulate the vagaries of the market, control shifting public appetites, and capitalize on campaigns to protect public morals. Rock 'n Roll was one such fringe culture; in the 1950s, Elvis blurred gender norms with his androgynous style and challenged conventions of public decency with his sexually-charged performances. By the end of the 1960s, Bob Dylan introduced the social consciousness of folk music into the rock scene, and The Beatles embraced hippie counter-culture. Don McLean's 1971 anthem \"American Pie\" served as an epitaph for rock's political core, which had been replaced by the spectacle of hard rock acts such as Kiss and Alice Cooper. While Rock 'n Roll did not lose its ability to shock, in less than three decades it became part of the established order that it had originally sought to challenge. With Amusement for All provides the context to what Americans have done for fun since 1830, showing the reciprocal nature of the relationships between social, political, economic, and cultural forces and the way in which the entertainment world has reflected, refracted, or reinforced the values those forces represent in America.</P>", "isbn": "9780813141329", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/The%20University%20Press%20of%20Kentucky/9780813141329/1377070950.91.jpg", "oyster_summary": "", "average_rating": 4.17, "language_code": "eng", "awards": [], "title": "With Amusement for All", "publication_date": "2006-04-12", "number_print_pages": 712}, "position": 34, "uuid": "KeRScZFBfxwv6Kz2pW3EvZ", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"oyster_good_for_statement": "", "publisher": {"uuid": "ZTLSUALTGiEwRDsTDLtu5B", "name": "Basic Books"}, "status": 1, "author": "Adam Bradley", "uuid": "ynfKSXkyaZbmLTaJLmB3XW", "description": "<DIV>If asked to list the greatest innovators of modern American poetry, few of us would think to include Jay-Z or Eminem in their number.

In Freedom to Offend, Raymond J. Haberski Jr. investigates the movie culture that emerged as official censorship declined and details how the struggle to free the screen has influenced our contemporary understanding of art and taste. These conflicts over film content were fought largely in the theaters and courts of New York City in the decades following World War II. Many of the regulators and religious leaders who sought to ensure that no questionable content invaded the public consciousness were headquartered in New York, as were the critics, exhibitors, and activists who sought to expand the options available to moviegoers. Despite Hollywood's dominance of film production, New York proved to be not only the arena for struggles over film content but also the market where the financial fates of movies were sealed.  Advocates for a wider range of cinematic expression eventually prevailed against the forces of censorship, but Freedom to Offend is no simple homily on the triumph of freedom from repression. In his analysis of controversies surrounding films from The Bicycle Thief to Deep Throat, Haberski offers a cautionary tale about the responsible use of the twin privileges of free choice and free expression. In the libertine 1970s, arguments in favor of the public's right to see challenging and artistic films were twisted to provide intellectual cover for movies created solely to lure viewers with outrageous or titillating material. Social critics who stood against this emerging trend were lumped in with the earlier crusaders for censorship, though their criticism was usually rational rather than moralistic in nature. Freedom to Offend calls attention to what was lost as well as what was gained when movie culture freed itself from the restrictions of the early postwar years. Haberski exposes the unquestioning defense of the doctrine of free expression as a form of absolutism that mirrors the censorial impulse found among the postwar era's restrictive moral guardians. Beginning in New York and spreading across America throughout the twentieth century, the battles between these opposing worldviews set the stage for debates on the social effects of the work of artists and filmmakers.</P>", "isbn": "9780813138411", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/The%20University%20Press%20of%20Kentucky/9780813138411/1377070926.76.jpg", "oyster_summary": "", "average_rating": 0.0, "language_code": "eng", "awards": [], "title": "Freedom to Offend", "publication_date": "2007-03-16", "number_print_pages": 280}, "position": 32, "uuid": "rUX3fFMedekWqTSJGsdiX7", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"oyster_good_for_statement": "", "publisher": {"uuid": "FyUTC2sWpzsFxQcwo22JD6", "name": "Zest"}, "status": 1, "author": "Meghan Doherty", "uuid": "k5kHbTDc9FK9hH8XggcJa7", "description": "<DIV></DIV>  On the one hand, nobody wants to be a dick.

Why all the cheating? Why now?&#160; Callahan pins the blame on the dog-eat-dog economic climate of the past two decades. An unfettered market and unprecedented economic inequality have corroded our values, he argues-and ultimately threaten the level playing field so central to American democracy itself. Through revealing interviews and extensive data, he takes us on a gripping tour of cheating in America and offers a powerful argument for why it matters. Lucidly written, scrupulously argued, The Cheating Culture is an important, original examination of the hidden costs of the boom years.<BR><BR></DIV>", "isbn": "9780156035576", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Houghton%20Mifflin%20Harcourt/9780156035576/1376379662.99.jpg", "oyster_summary": "", "average_rating": 3.38, "language_code": "eng", "awards": [], "title": "The Cheating Culture", "publication_date": "2007-02-01", "number_print_pages": 368}, "position": 0, "uuid": "WkKqtR9KnwFs7t6V88rxvF", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"oyster_good_for_statement": "", "publisher": {"uuid": "2KAyLpyKhNvjq9gAmobD9", "name": "Verso"}, "status": 1, "author": "Jonathan Crary", "uuid": "rikqDf9GdqWnFFL5Ycj88n", "description": "<p><em>24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep</em> explores some of the ruinous consequences of the expanding non-stop processes of twenty-first-century capitalism.

Once our hominid ancestors began cooking their food, the human digestive tract shrank and the brain grew. Time once spent chewing tough raw food could be sued instead to hunt and to tend camp. Cooking became the basis for pair bonding and marriage, created the household, and even led to a sexual division of labor. Tracing the contemporary implications of our ancestors&rsquo; diets, <i>Catching Fire</i> sheds new light on how we came to be the social, intelligent, and sexual species we are today.

And then the bottom fell out.  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Detroit: A Biography takes a long, unflinching look at the evolution of one of America&#8217;s great cities, and one of the nation&#8217;s greatest urban failures. It seeks to explain how the city grew to become the heart of American industry and how its utter collapse resulted from a confluence of public policies, private industry decisions, and deep, thick seams of racism. And it raises the question: when we look at modern-day Detroit, are we looking at the ghost of America&#8217;s industrial past or its future?  &#160;  Scott Martelle is the author of The Fear Within and Blood Passion and is a professional journalist who has written for the Detroit News, the Los Angeles Times, the Rochester Times-Union, and more.
