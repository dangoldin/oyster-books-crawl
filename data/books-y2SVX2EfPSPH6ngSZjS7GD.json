This crusade for the American wilderness was perhaps the greatest U.S. presidential initiative between the Civil War and World War I. Roosevelt's most important legacies led to the creation of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and passage of the Antiquities Act in 1906. His executive orders saved such treasures as Devils Tower, the Grand Canyon, and the Petrified Forest.</p><p>Tracing the role that nature played in Roosevelt's storied career, Brinkley brilliantly analyzes the influence that the works of John James Audubon and Charles Darwin had on the young man who would become our twenty-sixth president. With descriptive flair, the author illuminates Roosevelt's bird watching in the Adirondacks, wildlife obsession in Yellowstone, hikes in the Blue Ridge Mountains, ranching in the Dakota Territory, hunting in the Big Horn Mountains, and outdoor romps through Idaho and Wyoming. He also profiles Roosevelt's incredible circle of naturalist friends, including the Catskills poet John Burroughs, Boone and Crockett Club cofounder George Bird Grinnell, forestry zealot Gifford Pinchot, buffalo breeder William Hornaday, Sierra Club founder John Muir, U.S. Biological Survey wizard C. Hart Merriam, Oregon Audubon Society founder William L. Finley, and pelican protector Paul Kroegel, among many others. He brings to life hilarious anecdotes of wild-pig hunting in Texas and badger saving in Kansas, wolf catching in Oklahoma and grouse flushing in Iowa. Even the story of the teddy bear gets its definitive treatment.</p><p>Destined to become a classic, this extraordinary and timeless biography offers a penetrating and colorful look at Roosevelt's naturalist achievements, a legacy now more important than ever. Raising a Paul Revere&#8211;like alarm about American wildlife in peril&#8212;including buffalo, manatees, antelope, egrets, and elk&#8212;Roosevelt saved entire species from probable extinction. As we face the problems of global warming, overpopulation, and sustainable land management, this imposing leader's stout resolution to protect our environment is an inspiration and a contemporary call to arms for us all. </p>", "isbn": "9780061940576", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/HarperCollins/9780061940576/1376528571.66.jpg", "oyster_summary": "", "average_rating": 3.91, "language_code": "eng", "awards": [{"image": null, "uuid": "TAR7ToA2sHGZVqtkLY9wC6", "name": "New York Times Bestseller"}], "title": "The Wilderness Warrior", "publication_date": "2009-07-28", "number_print_pages": 960}, "position": 9, "uuid": "dyqqAKiUTAhuvkSpGYjPD5", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"oyster_good_for_statement": "", "publisher": {"uuid": "JF5MfvwqSP8mnQDsRVecbZ", "name": "Or Books"}, "status": 1, "author": "Reverend Billy", "uuid": "QuyLcWeZqwns9VjfSF9eXK", "description": "<p>In pages that crackle with the lightning of an electric storm, the Reverend Billy, messianic leader of the Church of Stop Shopping, thunders from his pulpit, sounding the tocsin on the toxins that are poisoning our planet.</p>", "isbn": "9781939293942", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Or%20Books/9781939293942/1382549545.82.jpg", "oyster_summary": "", "average_rating": 0.0, "language_code": "English", "awards": [], "title": "The End of the World", "publication_date": "2013-02-13", "number_print_pages": 118}, "position": 20, "uuid": "eNzy7ZFwxCD77oEx4jLjc", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"oyster_good_for_statement": "", "publisher": {"uuid": "mgiqkRVmdsaEkGeGuyRSFX", "name": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"}, "status": 1, "author": "Mary Roach", "uuid": "RjSUDUEATa6RL6jYfQY2Fc", "description": "<div>   The Best American Series&#174;   <br>First, Best, and Best-Selling   <br>   <br>The Best American series is the premier annual showcase for the country&#8217;s finest short fiction and nonfiction.

Forest rangers had assembled nearly ten thousand men to fight the fires, but no living person had seen anything like those flames, and neither the rangers nor anyone else knew how to subdue them. Egan recreates the struggles of the overmatched rangers against the implacable fire with unstoppable dramatic force, and the larger story of outsized president Teddy Roosevelt and his chief forester, Gifford Pinchot, that follows is equally resonant. Pioneering the notion of conservation, Roosevelt and Pinchot did nothing less than create the idea of public land as our national treasure, owned by every citizen. Even as TR's national forests were smoldering they were saved: The heroism shown by his rangers turned public opinion permanently in favor of the forests, though it changed the mission of the forest service in ways we can still witness today.  <p>This e-book includes a sample chapter of SHORT NIGHTS OF THE SHADOW CATCHER.", "isbn": "9780547416861", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Houghton%20Mifflin%20Harcourt/9780547416861/1392100341.13.jpg", "oyster_summary": "", "average_rating": 4.03, "language_code": "eng", "awards": [{"image": null, "uuid": "CVnhErxt74qgQNyD84ZsLb", "name": "National Book Award Winner"}, {"image": null, "uuid": "TAR7ToA2sHGZVqtkLY9wC6", "name": "New York Times Bestseller"}], "title": "The Big Burn", "publication_date": "2009-10-19", "number_print_pages": 336}, "position": 7, "uuid": "UhQHQqRFJ34fjZFT66vhkU", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"oyster_good_for_statement": "", "publisher": {"uuid": "mgiqkRVmdsaEkGeGuyRSFX", "name": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"}, "status": 1, "author": "Chris Mooney", "uuid": "omVTruCbqMvyNy9jiJkQYf", "description": "<DIV><DIV><DIV><P>Are hurricanes increasing in ferocity and frequency because of global warming?
