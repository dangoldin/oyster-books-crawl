Here Kilgore Trout is an itinerant wandering from one science fiction convention to another; he intersects with the protagonist, Dwayne Hoover (one of Vonnegut\u2019s typically boosterish, lost and stupid mid-American characters) and their intersection is the excuse for the evocation of many others, familiar and unfamiliar, dredged from Vonnegut\u2019s gallery. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The central issue is concerned with intersecting and apposite views of reality, and much of the narrative is filtered through Trout who is neither certifiably insane nor a visionary writer but can pass for either depending upon Dwayne Hoover\u2019s (and Vonnegut\u2019s) view of the situation. America, when this novel was published, was in the throes of Nixon, Watergate and the unraveling of our intervention in Vietnam; the nation was beginning to fragment ideologically and geographically, and Vonnegut sought to cram all of this dysfunction (and a goofy, desperate kind of hope, the irrational comfort given through the genre of science fiction) into a sprawling narrative whose sense, if any, is situational, not conceptual.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reviews were polarized; the novel was celebrated for its bizarre aspects, became the basis of a Bruce Willis movie adaptation whose reviews were not nearly so polarized.

Drawn largely from the 1950s and the slick magazine markets which Vonnegut had from the beginning of his career in the postwar period demonstrated an uncanny ability to sell, these stories show clearly that Vonnegut found his central themes early on as a writer. More, he had been able to place stories in great consumer magazines like <i>Colliers</i> (that his good friend and college classmate Knox Burger was editing <i>Colliers</i> during this time was perhaps no small factor in Vonnegut\u2019s success). There were only a handful of science fiction writers of Vonnegut\u2019s generation who were able to sell in such a broad manner outside of the genre during the \u201850s, but it was this success that allowed Vonnegut the consistent denial that he was not a science fiction writer at all.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Vonnegut\u2019s themes--folly, hypocrisy, misunderstanding--cycle through these stories although with perhaps somewhat less bitterness than what had come before. Even through the screen or scrim of magazine taboos, Vonnegut\u2019s voice is singular, infused by disaffection and wit. Most of Vonnegut\u2019s characters stagger through the plot full of misapprehension, cowardice, and self-delusion. In \u201cThanasphere,\u201d the achievement of space travel becomes a means of communicating with the dead (and for that reason the project is abandoned). In \u201cMnemonics,\u201d a forgetful protagonist is given a drug that prompts him to remember everything with the exception of an unrequited crush.

Waltz, a diarist, becomes symbolic of a person living a fraught post-technological life in which frailty is as likely to be a person\u2019s undoing as any bomb.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Waltz finally reaches the point of resignation; a realization and understanding that there are things that are just beyond our control and understanding that make all human motive, ambition, and circumstance absolutely irrelevant.

Meet Rabo Karabekian, a moderately successful surrealist painter, who we meet late in life and see struggling (like all of Vonnegut\u2019s key characters), with the dregs of unresolved pain and the consequences of brutality. Loosely based on the legend of Bluebeard (best realized in Bela Bartok\u2019s one-act opera), the novel follows Karabekian through the last events in his life that is heavy with women, painting, artistic ambition, artistic fraudulence, and as of yet unknown consequence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Vonnegut\u2019s intention here is not so much satirical (although the contemporary art scene would be easy enough to deconstruct), nor is it documentary (although Karabekian does carry elements of Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko). Instead, Vonnegut is using art for the same purpose he used science fiction cliches in <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>; as a filter through which he can illuminate the savagery, cruelty, and the essentially comic misdirection of human existence.</p>\n<p></p> \n<p>Readers will recognize familiar Vonnegut character types and archetypes as they drift in and out through the background; meanwhile, Karabekian, betrayed and betrayer, sinks through a bottomless haze of recollection. Like most of Vonnegut\u2019s late works, this is both science fiction and cruel contemporary realism at once, using science fiction as metaphor for human damage as well as failure to perceive. Readers will find that Vonnegut\u2019s protagonists can never really clarify for us whether they are ultimately unwitting victims or simple barbarians, leaving it up to the reader to determine in which genre this book really fits, if any at all.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kurt Vonnegut (1922-2007) is one of the most beloved American writers of the twentieth century.

His early work with its unequivocal statement of absurdity and hopelessness was now almost four decades behind when he completed this meditation on Darwinism, fate and the essential irrelevance of the human condition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Humanity has in the millions of years after inevitable holocaust and exile transmogrified into a race of not-quite-human seals on Darwin\u2019s Galapagos Islands. Leon Trotsky Trout, the son of Vonnegut\u2019s wretched familiar character Kilgore Trout, watches and broods over his no-longer-human descendants who have made natural selection a matter of debased survivalism. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Using a device common in his novels after <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, the material is presented in the form of a transcript or memoir; Trout unhappily witnesses a sad outcome which may nonetheless represent the best of all human possibilities. Trout\u2019s father Kilgore, in ghostly form, remains in communication, urging his son to cease observing and exit, but Leon will not take the opportunity, feeling linked to the pathetic, morphed shards of humanity who remain on the Islands. Whether the survival of the seals constitutes human survival, whether Kilgore and his son are imaginary fragments of evolutionary decay lurk as questions beneath a sequence of events which show Vonnegut trapped in the Age of Reagan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Vonnegut is trying to see through (rather than to shape) his material; the theme of the novel represents a kind of apotheosis and never has Vonnegut\u2019s ambiguous despair been more clearly revealed or more clearly made the engine of his narrative.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kurt Vonnegut (1922-2007) is one of the most beloved American writers of the twentieth century.

The story centers on brother and sister twins, children of Wilbur Swain, who are in sympathetic and (possibly) telepathic communication and who represent Vonnegut\u2019s relationship with his own sister who died young of cancer almost two decades before the book\u2019s publication.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Vonnegut dedicated this to Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Like their films and routines, this novel is an exercise in non-sequentiality and in the bizarre while using those devices to expose larger and terrible truths. The twins exemplify to Swain a kind of universal love; he campaigns for it while troops of technologically miniaturized Chinese are launched upon America. Love and carnage intersect in a novel contrived to combine credibility and common observation; critics could sense Vonnegut deliberately flouting narrative constraint or imperative in an attempt to destroy the very idea of the novel he was writing. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>Slapstick</i> becomes both product and commentary, event and self-criticism; an early and influential example of contemporary \u201cmetafiction.\u201d Vonnegut\u2019s tragic life--like the tragic lives of Laurel, Hardy, Buster Keaten and other exemplars of slapstick comedy--is the true center of a work whose cynicism overlays a trustfulness and sense of loss which are perhaps deeper and truer than expressed in any of Vonnegut\u2019s earlier or later works. <i>Slapstick</i> is a clear demonstration of the profound alliance of comedy and tragedy which, when Vonnegut is working close to his true sensibility, become indistinguishable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kurt Vonnegut (1922-2007) is one of the most beloved American writers of the twentieth century.

Vonnegut\u2019s absolute familiarity with science fiction tropes and his mocking contempt for them are well displayed in a story which shifts between tragic cartoon and straightforward projection. His highly evolved humans in an indeterminate future have become body-transcending spirits and Vonnegut handles this vaporous situation with deadpan comedy suspended over unspeakable loss, a characteristic technique. In its fluidity--the story is parody masked as extrapolation; no, it is a horror story in the form of a parody. This kind of cross-category narrative attack was often used by Vonnegut and makes him difficult to label; he is too serious to be funny, too absurd (as in jailbreak or as in the concept of Billy Pilgrim\u2019s alien Tralmalfadorians) to be taken as realism. Vonnegut when he wrote this story at 30 was still trying to find his voice, identify his material; as a laboratory of his enveloping subject matter and technique UNREADY TO WEAR is particularly interesting and disturbing, demonstrating that Vonnegut could have gone in any number of directions and perhaps by deliberately failing to make a decision, found his voice through indeterminacy.

It is a bitter, profoundly disenchanted story that satirizes  the military, authoritarianism, gender relationships, parenthood and  most of the assumed mid-century myths of the family. Haley Brandon, the  adolescent protagonist, comes to the farm of his relative, the old crazy  who insists upon being called The General, to learn to be a  straight-shooting American. Haley&rsquo;s only means of survival will lead him  to unflagging defiance of the General&rsquo;s deranged (but oh so American,  oh so military) values.
