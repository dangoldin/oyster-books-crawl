Tim Lihoreau has made it his business to uncover the myriad ways in which schadenfreude rears its wicked head, including \"nimbuphilia\" (to delight in driving wildly through a curb-side puddle which you know to be too close to a pedestrian) and \"famaphilia\" (to delight in witnessing a celebrity in an everyday pickle).&#160;He also discusses&#160;the particular delights of&#160;highlighting a person's mispronunciation (by pronouncing it properly),&#160;having a&#160;seat on the train while those around you stand, and being loud during another's hangover. Naming, defining, and explaining each one in turn with fascinating insights and erudite wit,&#160;this book&#160;drives at the heart of what it is we find so irresistibly delightful when faced with others' discomfort.</div>", "isbn": "9781907642388", "title": "Schadenfreude", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "status": 1, "publisher": {"uuid": "yqdGXWhdgE2VGR4NQRKZyd", "name": "Elliott & Thompson"}}, "annotation": "", "uuid": "p7yzQYAk67aAG4vX9KSL4b", "position": 6},{"book": {"oyster_summary": "", "number_print_pages": 240, "language_code": "eng", "publication_date": "2009-01-01", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Wings%20Press/Vienna%20Triangle/1372977653.16.jpg", "uuid": "CioU75daeW5D6RgNJqpz7k", "average_rating": 2.84, "author": "Brenda Webster", "awards": [], "description": "<DIV>A young woman named Kate explores her historical connection to the development of Freudian theory and the early beginnings of psychoanalysis in this mystery rooted in the past.

Yet most of us go through life assuming (and sometimes insisting) that we are right about nearly everything, from the origins of the universe to how to load the dishwasher. If being wrong is so natural, why are we all so bad at imagining that our beliefs could be mistaken, and why do we react to our errors with surprise, denial, defensiveness, and shame?</p><p>In <em>Being Wrong</em>, journalist Kathryn Schulz explores why we find it so gratifying to be right and so maddening to be mistaken, and how this attitude toward error corrodes relationships&#8212;whether between family members, colleagues, neighbors, or nations. Along the way, she takes us on a fascinating tour of human fallibility, from wrongful convictions to no-fault divorce; medical mistakes to misadventures at sea; failed prophecies to false memories; \"I told you so!\" to \"Mistakes were made.\" Drawing on thinkers as varied as Augustine, Darwin, Freud, Gertrude Stein, Alan Greenspan, and Groucho Marx, she proposes a new way of looking at wrongness. In this view, error is both a given and a gift&#8212;one that can transform our worldviews, our relationships, and, most profoundly, ourselves. </p><p>In the end, <em>Being Wrong</em> is not just an account of human error but a tribute to human creativity&#8212;the way we generate and revise our beliefs about ourselves and the world. At a moment when economic, political, and religious dogmatism increasingly divide us, Schulz explores with uncommon humor and eloquence the seduction of certainty and the crises occasioned by error.

We strain to be more efficient, to cram more into each minute, each hour, each day. Since the Industrial Revolution shifted the world into high gear, the cult of speed has pushed us to a breaking point. Consider these facts: Americans on average spend seventy-two minutes of every day behind the wheel of a car, a typical business executive now loses sixty-eight hours a year to being put on hold, and American adults currently devote on average a mere half hour per week to making love.</p><p>Living on the edge of exhaustion, we are constantly reminded by our bodies and minds that the pace of life is spinning out of control. <em>In Praise of Slowness</em> traces the history of our increasingly breathless relationship with time and tackles the consequences of living in this accelerated culture of our own creation. Why are we always in such a rush? What is the cure for time sickness? Is it possible, or even desirable, to slow down? Realizing the price we pay for unrelenting speed, people all over the world are reclaiming their time and slowing down the pace -- and living happier, healthier, and more productive lives as a result. A Slow revolution is taking place.</p><p>Here you will find no Luddite calls to overthrow technology and seek a preindustrial utopia. This is a modern revolution, championed by cell-phone using, e-mailing lovers of sanity. The Slow philosophy can be summed up in a single word -- balance. People are discovering energy and efficiency where they may have been least expected -- in slowing down.</p><p>In this engaging and entertaining exploration, award-winning journalist and rehabilitated speedaholic Carl Honor&#233; details our perennial love affair with efficiency and speed in a perfect blend of anecdotal reportage, history, and intellectual inquiry. <em>In Praise of Slowness</em> is the first comprehensive look at the worldwide Slow movements making their way into the mainstream -- in offices, factories, neighborhoods, kitchens, hospitals, concert halls, bedrooms, gyms, and schools.
