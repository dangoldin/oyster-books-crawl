Particularly during World War II, he seemed unable to see the bigger picture, exasperating his colleagues as he ignored their advice in favor of his own pet projects.<p>Backed up by rigorous research, Nigel Knight sheds startling new light on the life and career of Winston Churchill, shattering the sentimental myth of Churchill as 'the greatest Briton' and forcing his legacy to be reappraised.", "average_rating": 0.0, "author": "Nigel   Knight", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/F%2BW%20Media/Churchill%20the%20Greatest%20Briton%20Unmasked/1373184494.05.jpg"}},{"annotation": "", "uuid": "WoZJFeoAUXPwvJkVRd6hqe", "position": 35, "book": {"uuid": "Wnmqp4ET8acb9dfuXqpsDo", "status": 1, "oyster_summary": "", "language_code": "eng", "number_print_pages": 256, "title": "Everyman's England", "publication_date": "2012-06-01", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "isbn": "9780857654052", "publisher": {"uuid": "6cYqSxPt6UfWDgf7AGyCbb", "name": "Summersdale"}, "awards": [], "description": "<DIV><B>Recollected observations of England between World War I and II</B></DIV><DIV>&#160;</DIV><DIV>In this series of pen&#8211;portraits of England, commissioned by the <I>Daily Mail</I> in the 1930s,&#160;the pattern and color of the \"great fabric of English life\" from Cumberland to Cornwall is vividly conjured.&#160;The heartwarming, humorous, and often irreverent observations of sleepy villages, pastoral scenes, and busy industries provide a delightful insight into life between the wars.</DIV>", "average_rating": 0.0, "author": "Victor Canning", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Summersdale/9780857654052/1386330930.91.jpg"}},{"annotation": "", "uuid": "jdepZrNKwVHWi6nzUP8ksA", "position": 35, "book": {"uuid": "LpzbhfSXj3XqKpnwUiJTB4", "status": 1, "oyster_summary": "", "language_code": "eng", "number_print_pages": 160, "title": "Ancient Greece", "publication_date": "2008-04-28", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "isbn": "9781842435441", "publisher": {"uuid": "BsMmNZHMfrFvgDbWqgnRH3", "name": "Oldcastle Books"}, "awards": [], "description": "<DIV><DIV><P>Western civilization began with the Greeks.

It is now recognized as having had a considerable influence on the Renaissance and a significant impact in the shaping modern Europe. Modern historians are increasingly acknowledging the role the Byzantine Empire played in the development of both Islam and Christianity, and the relationship between the two. The term 'Byzantine' derives from the ancient Greek city of Byzantium founded in 667 BC by colonists from Megara. It was named in honor of their leader Byzas. It later became better known as Constantinople, that gateway between West and East and played a crucial role in the transmission of Christianity to the West. Constantine is now generally known as the first Christian Emperor, and in recent years interest in him has grown, with his role in the development of Christianity being questioned by Dan Brown, author of <I>The Da Vinci Code</I>, amongst others. A closer examination of this formative period in the history of the church reveals a struggle to gain a coherent and cohesive religious identity. Christianity would emerge as the major religion of the Byzantine Empire in a departure from the pagan worship of the Roman Empire. The Byzantine Empire was often at the centre of profound geopolitical, cultural, and religious forces that threatened to pull it apart. When Byzantine forces suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Manzikert for example, appeals to the West precipitated the First Crusade. In 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, Constantinople was conquered by the Crusader army. The dramatic siege and subsequent fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire is often seen as marking the end of the medieval period. The Byzantine Empire lasted for over a thousand years, created remarkable art and architecture and created a lasting cultural and religious legacy&#8212;even its decline and fall was to have ramifications that reached far beyond its borders. The fall of Constantinople which had been a key city on the ancient Silk Road, linking East and West led many to consider the prospect of opening up new lines of trade, sea exploration that would eventually lead to major new discoveries, new routes and new worlds.</DIV>", "average_rating": 2.66, "author": "Giles Morgan", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Oldcastle%20Books/Byzantium/1372982136.69.jpg"}},{"annotation": "", "uuid": "WTddkZoU2GWhj3jHsiaa4J", "position": 38, "book": {"uuid": "amncMuuqKmmoeNuF3aJvVP", "status": 1, "oyster_summary": "", "language_code": "eng", "number_print_pages": 160, "title": "A Short History of Europe", "publication_date": "2010-07-30", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "isbn": "9781842436660", "publisher": {"uuid": "BsMmNZHMfrFvgDbWqgnRH3", "name": "Oldcastle Books"}, "awards": [], "description": "<DIV><DIV><DIV><DIV><B>From the coronation of Charlemagne in 800 to the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007, an accessible history of the people, ideas, institutions, and events that have shaped Europe during the last 1,200 years</B></DIV></B></DIV></B></DIV><DIV>&#160;</DIV><DIV><DIV>This fascinating&#160;history for beginners&#160;provides a coherent map of the jumbled history of Europe and the European idea that has&#160;led up&#160;to this point.

The delegation presented the influential pope with a wealth of Chinese learning from a diverse range of fields: art, geography (including world maps that were passed on to Christopher Columbus and Ferdinand Magellan), astronomy, mathematics, printing, architecture, steel manufacturing, military weaponry, and more.

Carrying out a genocidal plundering of the Congo, he looted its rubber, brutalized its people, and ultimately slashed its population by ten million--all the while shrewdly cultivating his reputation as a great humanitarian. Heroic efforts to expose these crimes eventually led to the first great human rights movement of the twentieth century, in which everyone from Mark Twain to the Archbishop of Canterbury participated. King Leopold's Ghost is the haunting account of a megalomaniac of monstrous proportions, a man as cunning, charming, and cruel as any of the great Shakespearean villains. It is also the deeply moving portrait of those who fought Leopold: a brave handful of missionaries, travelers, and young idealists who went to Africa for work or adventure and unexpectedly found themselves witnesses to a holocaust. Adam Hochschild brings this largely untold story alive with the wit and skill of a Barbara Tuchman. Like her, he knows that history often provides a far richer cast of characters than any novelist could invent. Chief among them is Edmund Morel, a young British shipping agent who went on to lead the international crusade against Leopold. Another hero of this tale, the Irish patriot Roger Casement, ended his life on a London gallows. Two courageous black Americans, George Washington Williams and William Sheppard, risked much to bring evidence of the Congo atrocities to the outside world.

The country&#8217;s emergence as a prosperous European Union nation would be financed in part, it turns out, by a cache of Nazi gold.</DIV>", "average_rating": 0.0, "author": "Neill Lochery", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/PublicAffairs/9781586488802/1387371117.34.jpg"}},{"annotation": "", "uuid": "BqV9Db5vW7FQStwSqC5g87", "position": 61, "book": {"uuid": "zmxaRHiD8HNvT52oHFenpE", "status": 1, "oyster_summary": "", "language_code": "eng", "number_print_pages": 256, "title": "Ajax, the Dutch, the War", "publication_date": "2012-09-11", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "isbn": "9781568587240", "publisher": {"uuid": "6drzwNs6sqMUS2pmUcB6rn", "name": "Nation Books"}, "awards": [], "description": "<DIV>When most people think about the Netherlands, images of tulips and peaceful pot smoking residents spring to mind.

For decades, the Dutch have enjoyed the reputation of having a &#147;good war.&#8221; The myth is even resonant in Israel where Ajax is celebrated. The fact is, the Jews suffered shocking persecution at the hands of Dutch collaborators. Holland had the second largest Nazi movement in Europe outside Germany, and in no other country except Poland was so high a percentage of Jews deported.<br><BR>Kuper challenges Holland&#8217;s historical amnesia and uses soccer&#151;particularly the experience of Ajax, a club long supported by Amsterdam&#8217;s Jews&#151;as a window on wartime Holland and Europe. Through interviews with Resistance fighters, survivors, wartime soccer players and more, Kuper uncovers this history that has been ignored, and also finds out why the Holocaust had a profound effect on soccer in the country.<br><BR>Ajax produced Cruyuff but was also built by members of the Dutch resistance and Holocaust survivors. It became a surrogate family for many who survived the war and its method for producing unparalleled talent became the envy of clubs around the world.
