Rediscover--or discover for the first time--a master of science fiction who, according to the New York Times, was \"a precursor to Douglas Adams.\" CROMPTON DIVIDED was also published in the UK under the title THE ALCHEMICAL MARRIAGE OF ALISTAIR CROMPTON. Alastair Crompton skilled nosologist at Psychosmell, Inc. sniffs out something he's been missing his whole life--his other selves. His disturbed psyche was divided into three parts and the other parts were implanted in other bodies on other planets. His obsession to re-unite himself leads to disturbing discoveres about the underpinnings of the society he lives in, personal conflicts, a vastly destructive war and a shocking ultimate revelation. The master of SF madness operates at the top of his form. \"In case anyone has managed to miss this singular author's seminal influence on the world of imaginative literature, my best advice is to throw oneself in the way of CROMPTON DIVIDED and give onself up to wonderful madness.\"--Harlan Ellison", "isbn": "9781617561757", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/E-Reads/9781617561757/1391667283.62.jpg", "oyster_summary": "", "average_rating": 0.0, "language_code": "eng", "awards": [], "title": "Crompton Divided", "publication_date": "2014-02-04", "number_print_pages": 0}, "position": 31, "uuid": "2nitKnfjXtjCq5Nk9McLbT", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"oyster_good_for_statement": "", "publisher": {"uuid": "mgiqkRVmdsaEkGeGuyRSFX", "name": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"}, "status": 1, "author": "J.R.R.
