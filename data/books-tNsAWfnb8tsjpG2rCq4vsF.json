Kilmer-Purcell is a terrifically gifted new literary voice who straddles the divide between absurdity and normalcy, and stitches them together with surprising humor and lonely poignancy.  As Booklist raved \"as tart and funny as a Noel Coward play, for Kilmer-Purcell is especially good at dialogue, and, as in Coward's best plays, under the comedy lies the sad truth that even at our best, we are all weak, fallible fools. Again and again in this rich, adventure-filled book, Kilmer-Purcell illustrates the truth of Blake's proverb, 'The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.'\"</p>", "isbn": "9780061860843", "title": "I Am Not Myself These Days", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "status": 1, "publisher": {"uuid": "ef6mgBa3njWeiz46odozni", "name": "HarperCollins"}}, "annotation": "", "uuid": "8iq9mUwg53zJLSsqjj7cv4", "position": 0},{"book": {"oyster_summary": "", "number_print_pages": 512, "language_code": "eng", "publication_date": "2011-07-19", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Pegasus%20Books/9781453218303/1378375023.35.jpg", "uuid": "QcRnGbZrF2Zq3LLrJYqLQV", "average_rating": 4.51, "author": "Christopher L.

Just ten years after his escape, Pennington was ordained as a priest after studying at Yale and was soon traveling all over the world as an anti-slavery advocate. He was so well respected by European audiences that the University of Heidelberg awarded him an honorary doctorate, making him the first person of African descent to receive such a degree. This treatment was a far cry from his home across the Atlantic, where people like him, although no longer slaves, were still second-class citizens.<BR><BR></div><DIV></div>As he fought for equal rights in America, Pennington&rsquo;s voice was not limited to the preacher&rsquo;s pulpit. He wrote the first-ever &ldquo;History of the Colored People&rdquo; as well as a careful study of the moral basis for civil disobedience, which would be echoed decades later by Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. More than a century before Rosa Parks took her monumental bus ride, Pennington challenged segregated seating in New York City street cars. He was beaten and arrested, but eventually vindicated when the New York State Supreme Court ordered the cars to be integrated. Although the struggle for equality was far from over, Pennington retained a delightful sense of humor, intellectual vivacity, and inspiring faith through it all. <i>American to the Backbone</i> brings to life this fascinating, forgotten pioneer, who helped lay the foundation for the contemporary civil rights revolution and inspire generations of future leaders. <BR>", "isbn": "9781453218303", "title": "American to the Backbone", "oyster_good_for_statement": "", "status": 1, "publisher": {"uuid": "qTLqrjRbf63mYApvNa29HG", "name": "Pegasus Books"}}, "annotation": "", "uuid": "qXphGBdCVuWjf56cf77LVS", "position": 8},{"book": {"oyster_summary": "", "number_print_pages": 136, "language_code": "eng", "publication_date": "2012-05-11", "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Diversion%20Books/The%20Wit%20and%20Wisdom%20of%20Yogi%20Berra/1372976485.24.jpg", "uuid": "kCL2g6NDz5vcAKXPi4PvQK", "average_rating": 3.47, "author": "Phil Pepe", "awards": [], "description": "<DIV>Author Phil Pepe takes readers along on Yogi Berra&rsquo;s journey from St. Louis to New York's Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium, including all the stops along the way--from his days as a tack-puller in a women's shoe factory, to his dedicated night St. Louis before a game between the Yankees and the St. Louis Browns, when he coined the phrase, &quot; I&#160;want to thank all those that made this night necessary&quot;, to his induction into the Hall of Fame.<BR><BR>Phil Pepe explores Yogi Berra as a boy, player, hero, coach, manager, husband, and father, and jokester, including all of the &lsquo;Yogi-isms&rsquo;, in an absorbing treatment that is simultaneously comical, thoughtful, and biographical.<BR><BR>Famous &lsquo;Yogi-isms&rsquo;:<BR>&#160;- About a popular restaurant: &quot;Nobody goes there anymore.
