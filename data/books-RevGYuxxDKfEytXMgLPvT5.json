Derek Jeter is their hero. He walks in the footsteps of Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, and Mantle, and someday his shadow will loom just as large. Yet he has never been the best player in baseball. In fact, he hasn&#8217;t always been the best player on his team. But his intangible grace and Jordanesque ability to play big in the biggest of postseason moments make him the face of the modern Yankee dynasty, and of America&#8217;s game.</P>  In <I>The Captain</I>, best-selling author Ian O&#8217;Connor draws on extensive reporting and unique access to Jeter that has spanned some fifteen years to&#160; reveal how a biracial kid from Michigan became New York&#8217;s most beloved sports figure and the enduring symbol of the steroid-free athlete. O&#8217;Connor takes us behind the scenes of a legendary baseball life and career, from Jeter&#8217;s early struggles in the minor leagues, when homesickness and errors in the field threatened a stillborn career, to his heady days as a Yankee superstar and prince of the city who squired some of the world&#8217;s most beautiful women, to his tense battles with former best friend A-Rod. We also witness Jeter struggling to come to terms with his declining skills and the declining favor of the only organization he ever wanted to play for, leading to a contentious contract negotiation with the Yankees that left people wondering if Jeter might end his career in a uniform without pinstripes.</P>  Derek Jeter&#8217;s march toward the Hall of Fame has been dignified and certain, but behind that leadership and hero&#8217;s grace there are hidden struggles and complexities that have never been explored, until now. As Jeter closes in on 3,000 hits, a number no Yankee has ever touched, <I>The Captain</I> offers an incisive, exhilarating, and revealing new look at one of the game&#8217;s greatest players in the gloaming of his career.</div>", "oyster_good_for_statement": ""}, "position": 0, "uuid": "TdmR5D6EXKcfGZJWYGJRWB", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"author": "Mitchell Nathanson", "publication_date": "2012-02-29", "oyster_summary": "", "status": 1, "language_code": "eng", "number_print_pages": 272, "title": "A People's History of Baseball", "uuid": "ZM3YLShGKZkMxPpwbgSooL", "awards": [], "publisher": {"name": "University of Illinois Press", "uuid": "kEZyg4HDgiScw6jmfVU3ee"}, "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/University%20of%20Illinois%20Press/9780252093920/1377658037.62.jpg", "average_rating": 3.92, "isbn": "9780252093920", "description": "Baseball is much more than the national pastime.

Exploring the founding of the National League, Nathanson focuses on the newer Americans who sought club ownership to promote their own social status in the increasingly closed caste of late nineteenth-century America. His perspective on the rise and public rebuke of the Players Association shows that these events reflect both the collective spirit of working and middle-class America in the mid-twentieth century as well as the countervailing forces that sought to beat back this emerging movement that threatened the status quo. Even his take on baseball's racial integration that began with Branch Rickeys \"Great Experiment\" reveals the debilitating effects of the harsh double standard that resulted, requiring a black player to have unimpeachable character merely to take the field in a Major League game, a standard no white player was required to meet._x000B__x000B_Told with passion and occasional outrage, A People's History of Baseball challenges the perspective of the well-known, deeply entrenched, hyper-patriotic stories of baseball and offers an incisive alternative history of America's much-loved national pastime.", "oyster_good_for_statement": ""}, "position": 1, "uuid": "jUoV8sQpS9Tz2RXGgyiTpj", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"author": "Buzz Bissinger", "publication_date": "2006-04-04", "oyster_summary": "", "status": 1, "language_code": "eng", "number_print_pages": 304, "title": "Three Nights in August", "uuid": "QZ5o74uvhEAb4EECNrTmDj", "awards": [{"name": "New York Times Bestseller", "uuid": "TAR7ToA2sHGZVqtkLY9wC6", "image": null}], "publisher": {"name": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "uuid": "mgiqkRVmdsaEkGeGuyRSFX"}, "cover_img": "https://cflare.oysterbooks.com/covers/Houghton%20Mifflin%20Harcourt/9780547526713/1376382465.0.jpg", "average_rating": 3.85, "isbn": "9780547526713", "description": "<P><I>Three Nights in August</I> captures the strategic and emotional complexities of baseball's quintessential form, the three-game series.

The title page in the novel reads; \"by Henry W. Wiggen / Certain of His Enthusiasms Restrained by Mark Harris\", the author's personal touch that tells us (the reader) that we are about to enter a genial, conversational first-person story.</p><p>\n</p><p>\nWiggen is a gifted pitcher in the major leagues, playing for a team that includes a mediocre catcher named Bruce Pearson--a slow-talking Georgia boy who tries the patience of the team. Pearson has a secret; he has been diagnosed with Hodgkins' disease which threatens not only his life but also the baseball career that he so desperately wants. When Wiggen learns of Pearson's illness, their casual acquaintanceship deepens into a profound friendship. Wiggen fights heroically to keep Pearson on the team, saving his friend from being sent down to the minors, and he also rallies other teammates to help his friend. The miracle is that Pearson is transformed into a better ballplayer... but the miracle is brief for the man's time has already run out.</p><p>\n</p><p>\nIn lesser hands, this story could be cloying or overly sentimental, but Harris writes with a gentle, unassuming dignity. His freewheeling colloquial style verges on an easy stream of consciousness. Wiggen is an engaging character and his observations are lucid and refreshing. The characters are wonderfully realized, from the drawling Pearson to team manager Dutch Schnell. It may be that what makes <i>Bang the Drum Slowly</i>a great novel is that it is not entirely a sports novel but also a warm human comedy complete with believable real-life tragic events, set in the familiar, magical world of American baseball.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<i>Bang the Drum Slowly</i> is #14 on the <i>Sports Illustrated</i> Greatest 100 Sports books.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>", "oyster_good_for_statement": ""}, "position": 35, "uuid": "rjeu3wthnPPUxPQiBPkmua", "annotation": ""},{"book": {"author": "Claude R.
